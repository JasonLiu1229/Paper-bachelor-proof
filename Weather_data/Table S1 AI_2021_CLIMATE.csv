DAEPWEMU,journalArticle,2021,"Chen, Wei-Han; You, Fengqi",Semiclosed Greenhouse Climate Control Under Uncertainty via Machine Learning and Data-Driven Robust Model Predictive Control,IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,,1558-0865,10.1109/TCST.2021.3094999,,"This work proposes a novel data-driven robust model predictive control (DDRMPC) framework for automatic control of greenhouse in-door climate. The framework integrates dynamic control models of greenhouse temperature, humidity, and CO₂ concentration level with data-driven robust optimization models that accurately and rigorously capture uncertainty in weather forecast error. Data-driven uncertainty sets for ambient temperature, solar radiation, and humidity are constructed from historical data by leveraging a machine learning approach, namely, support vector clustering with weighted generalized intersection kernel. A training-calibration procedure that tunes the size of uncertainty sets is implemented to ensure that data-driven uncertainty sets attain an appropriate performance guarantee. In order to solve the optimization problem in DDRMPC, an affine disturbance feedback policy is utilized to obtain tractable approximations of optimal control. A case study of controlling temperature, humidity, and CO₂ concentration of a semiclosed greenhouse in New York City is presented. The results show that the DDRMPC approach ends up with 14% and 4% lower total cost than rule-based control and robust model predictive control with L₁-norm-based uncertainty set, respectively. The constraint violation probability, which is the percentage of time that the greenhouse system states violate the constraint throughout the whole growing period, for DDRMPC is only 0.39%. Hence, the proposed DDRMPC framework can prevent the greenhouse climate from becoming harmful to plants and fruits. In conclusion, the proposed DDRMPC approach can improve the greenhouse climate control performance and reduce cost compared with other control strategies.",2021,2021/12/3 14:48,2021/12/3 14:48,,12-1月,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology,,,,,Agriculture; Controlled environment agriculture; data-driven robust optimization; Green products; greenhouse climate control; Humidity; robust model predictive control (RMPC); Solar radiation; Temperature distribution; Uncertainty; uncertainty.\vspace-3pt; Weather forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to develop an early forecasting model of cereal yields (soft wheat, barley and durum wheat) at the scale of the agricultural province considering the 15 most productive over 2000–2017 (i.e., 15 × 18 = 270 yields values). To this objective, we built on previous works that showed a tight linkage between cereal yields and various datasets including weather data (rainfall and air temperature), regional climate indices (North Atlantic Oscillation in particular), and drought indices derived from satellite observations in different wavelengths. The combination of the latter three data sets is assessed to predict cereal yields using linear (Multiple Linear Regression, MLR) and non-linear (Support Vector Machine, SVM; Random Forest, RF, and eXtreme Gradient Boost, XGBoost) machine learning algorithms. The calibration of the algorithmic parameters of the different approaches are carried out using a 5-fold cross validation technique and a leave-one-out method is implemented for model validation. The statistical metrics of the models are first analyzed as a function of the input datasets that are used, and as a function of the lead times, from 4 months to 2 months before harvest. The results show that combining data from multiple sources outperformed models based on one dataset only. In addition, the satellite drought indices are a major source of information for cereal prediction when the forecasting is carried out close to harvest (2 months before), while weather data and, to a lesser extent, climate indices, are key variables for earlier predictions. The best models can accurately predict yield in January (4 months before harvest) with an R2 = 0.88 and RMSE around 0.22 t. ha−1. The XGBoost method exhibited the best metrics. Finally, training a specific model separately for each group of provinces, instead of one global model, improved the prediction performance by reducing the RMSE by 10% to 35% depending on the provinces. In conclusion, the results of this study pointed out that combining remote sensing drought indices with climate and weather variables using a machine learning technique is a promising approach for cereal yield forecasting.",1月-21,2021/12/3 14:48,2021/12/3 14:48,2021/12/3 14:48,3101,,16,13,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 16 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/QKYMFSE6/Bouras et al. - 2021 - Cereal Yield Forecasting with Satellite Drought-Ba.pdf,,,climate indices; crop yield forecasting; machine learning; remote sensing drought indices; semiarid region; weather data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Machine learning was used to capture the nonlinear regression of climate extremes, and the Theil–Sen method with the Mann–Kendall significant test was used to calculate the slopes of their linear trends. During the global warming hiatus, annual and summer (JJA) warmest days TXx and the number of summer days SU over the whole of China and most of its four subregions were found to decrease relative to the HIS and RF periods. Annual and winter (DJF) coldest nights TNn over China and its four subregions were found to decrease moderately relative to the HIS and RF periods, whereas the number of frost days FD increased consistently. Precipitation extremes showed more temporal and spatial variability than temperature extremes. Trends of annual and JJA wet extremes during the hiatus were found to decrease relative to the HIS and RF periods, whereas the dry extreme index during the hiatus was found to increase generally over China and in most subregions.

For countries producing agricultural commodities, the climate affects the quantity and quality of products. Many methods have been proposed to keep track of climate. One traditional method is the weather station model, which indicates the temperature, wind speed, and direction and extent of cloud cover. However, this method of predicting climate change has low accuracy due to geographical variation, for example, mountainous or forested areas. Recently, a combination of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and machine learning (ML) has been considered for prediction with the Internet of Things (IoT), for instance, through a wireless body area network. For climate change prediction, we design and develop a control system that uses node sensors to collect data in sandhills and beaches, with data management conducted via a web application with three components. The first component is designed to collect data from the node sensors. The second component is mainly used to control the system through a web application. The third component uses linear regression in ML to analyze the data to predict weight and volume. The complete system has been tried and tested in real time on a 10-m2 area of a beach at Binh Thuan province, Vietnam, where sensor node data were wirelessly collected over a cloud using a web application.

While the number of feature variables in buildings is considerable, in many cases, a reliable dataset is only obtained from the target building operation through unique features. This results in insufficient data for building an operable ML model. In this study, we proposed a methodology applying a robust algorithm and carefully selected feature variables based on building physics. An operation using climate-adaptive building shells is presented as a case study. Energy simulations utilizing a generic office building model equipped with electrochromic glasses were performed on 2016–2019 weather data from Tokyo and Fukuoka, Japan. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm was employed for the ML application because of its robustness regarding small datasets, and feature variables were prearranged and carefully chosen to set an adequate combination between the numbers of feature and objective variables. Without ML, the air conditioning system operation became unstable in intermediate seasons. The ML application successfully solved this problem; 95% of the undesired cooling operation was avoided. The results prove that a simple ML algorithm could become a better solution than a complex one in cases where building physics based on building engineers’ knowledge is effectively utilized. It expands the ML application in various building operations, even in cases that do not respond to the direct application of complex ML techniques that require large datasets, known as “big data.”",2021/11/1,2021/12/3 14:49,2021/12/3 14:49,2021/12/3 14:49,103027,,,43,,Journal of Building Engineering,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,AI; Building Façade; CABS; Dynamic façade system; Electrochromic glass; Solar gain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a series of papers, we propose a strategy for process-based calibration of climate models that uses machine learning techniques. It relies on systematic comparisons of single-column versions of climate models with explicit simulations of boundary-layer dynamics and clouds (Large-Eddy Simulations [LES]). This paper focuses on the calibration of cloud geometry parameters (vertical overlap, horizontal heterogeneity, and cloud size) that appear in the parameterization of radiation. The solar component of a radiative transfer (RT) scheme that includes a parameterization for 3D radiative effects of clouds (SPARTACUS) is run in offline single-column mode on an ensemble of input cloud profiles synthesized from LES outputs. The space of cloud geometry parameter values is efficiently explored by sampling a large number of parameter sets (configurations) from which radiative metrics are computed using fast surrogate models that emulate the SPARTACUS solver. The sampled configurations are evaluated by comparing these radiative metrics to reference values provided by a 3D RT Monte Carlo model. The best calibrated configurations yield better predictions of TOA and surface fluxes than the one that uses parameter values computed from the 3D cloud fields: The root-mean-square errors averaged over cumulus cloud fields and solar angles are reduced from ∼10 Wm−2 with LES-derived parameters to ∼5 Wm−2 with adjusted parameters. However, the calibration of cloud geometry fails to reduce the errors on absorption, which remain around 2–4 Wm−2.",2021,2021/12/3 14:49,2021/12/3 14:49,2021/12/3 14:49,e2020MS002423,,4,13,,,Process-Based Climate Model Development Harnessing Machine Learning,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020MS002423,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/DPI9ZVDW/Villefranque et al. - 2021 - Process-Based Climate Model Development Harnessing.pdf,,,Large-Eddy Simulations; machine learning; Monte Carlo methods; process-oriented model tuning; radiation parameterization,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impacts of global warming are felt unprecedentedly in a wide variety of ways from shifting weather patterns that threatens food production, to rising sea levels that deteriorates the risk of catastrophic flooding. Among all aspects related to global warming, there is a growing concern on water resource management. This field is targeted at preventing future water crisis threatening human beings. The very first stage in such management is to recognize the prospective climate parameters influencing the future water resource conditions. Numerous prediction models, methods and tools, in this case, have been developed and applied so far. In line with trend, the current study intends to compare three optimization algorithms on the platform of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network to explore any meaningful connection between large-scale climate indices (LSCIs) and precipitation in the capital of Iran, a country which is located in an arid and semi-arid region and suffers from severe water scarcity caused by mismanagement over years and intensified by global warming. This situation has propelled a great deal of population to immigrate towards more developed cities within the country especially towards Tehran. Therefore, the current and future environmental conditions of this city especially its water supply conditions are of great importance. To tackle this complication an outlook for the future precipitation should be provided and appropriate forecasting trajectories compatible with this region’s characteristics should be developed. To this end, the present study investigates three training methods namely backpropagation (BP), genetic algorithms (GAs), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms on a MLP platform. Two frameworks distinguished by their input compositions are denoted in this study: Concurrent Model Framework (CMF) and Integrated Model Framework (IMF). Through these two frameworks, 13 cases are generated: 12 cases within CMF, each of which contains all selected LSCIs in the same lead-times, and one case within IMF that is constituted from the combination of the most correlated LSCIs with Tehran precipitation in each lead-time. Following the evaluation of all model performances through related statistical tests, Taylor diagram is implemented to make comparison among the final selected models in all three optimization algorithms, the best of which is found to be MLP-PSO in IMF.",2020/9/1,2021/12/3 14:49,2021/12/3 14:49,2021/12/3 14:49,854-864,,5,12,,J.

Climate resilience planning, supported by ML and AI, can enhance inclusive decision making by incorporating multitude of inputs from communities. More specifically, we aim to identify and assess coastal resilience with a focused case study of the greater Boston area with an emphasis on vulnerable communities. We develop an urban climate resilience decision model and process that employs machine learning to iteratively analyze climate resilience data sets, including social data from communities. The enhanced model can accommodate various sets of climate criteria as well as social attributes to improve data analyses. For instance, the real-time data of natural hazards, such as flooding conditions, can be analyzed with ML to understand the clusters of hazards. Decision makers considering social and regulatory factors can influence the ranking of climate vulnerabilities assessments in urban areas. In doing so, we also provide further understanding to the use and application of AI in IS literature (Collins, et al., 2021). AI, ML, and sustainability literature in information systems (IS) can aid in facilitating environmental governance and deliver solutions to improve organizational processes and individual practices (Nishant, Kennedy, and Corbett, 2020). Most of the previous research on climate change and coastal resilience is focused on scientific observations. For example, classification methods were applied to historical flood behaviors to understand flood resilience (Saraviet al., 2019). The impact of community and climate factors on agricultural vulnerabilities in the coastal regions of Bangladesh were measured using ML techniques to help improve resource planning and management (Jakariya et al., 2020). The analysis can help us understand climate risks on infrastructure needs and vulnerable communities. Boston initiatives, such as Climate Ready Boston and the Natural Hazard Mitigation Plan has identified some of these risks based on scientific data. Boston neighborhoods can be assessed in terms of climate resilience and climate equity based on their potential differences in environmental attributes (i.e., coastal flooding risk) by integrating it with social data. Our research will particularly focus on historically vulnerable communities, such as Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) communities, that are historically both economically and racially discriminated as well as are likely to see disproportionate impact of climate change. We have conducted exploratory data collection and analysis from Twitter, Facebook, and climate-focused blogs to understand the climate criteria influencing the livelihood of BIPOC community members, such as climate change impact on infrastructure needs. For example, flooding during a 2018 storm required rescuing of trapped residents in a coastal Boston neighborhood. Our model aims to analyze data from these communities for coastal resilience planning and decision making. The theoretical foundations of the study will be adapted from IS literature, including AI, big data analytics, decision models in climate change, and empirical evaluation methods. Although data analytics techniques have been adapted for DSS, incorporating big data, such as images and videos, to address theory and practice is a challenge (Bharati, 2017, pp. 273-276). Social factors play an important role in decision making on sustainability (Carberry et al., 2019) and the role of information systems is integral to solving climate change challenges (Seidel et al., 2017). While the modeling of applications with a spatial element, such as flexible geographic information system (GIS) software, can be enhanced with big data and machine learning, the facets of AI (autonomy, learning, and inscrutability) can challenge the norms, processes and outcomes in computing, business, and society (Berente, Gu, Recker, and Santhanam, 2021). We plan to address these challenges by extending IS theories to further our understanding of climate change impact. We have collected data related to key coastal measurements, social media data on coastal resilience discourse from BIPOC Boston communities, and data on coastal resilience planning and strategies. The data sets on coastal measurements are collected from public datasets, such as from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We plan to further examine the climate datasets and social data to develop a decision model that leverages ML techniques. The outcomes of this research can help community members and policy makers make more robust sustainability and climate focused decisions.",2021/10/30,2021/12/3 14:49,2021/12/3 14:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/FRUBW689/10.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If it is possible to analyze information from media outlet data created on real time by using text mining technique, various climate change issues can be understood. In this comparative study, therefore will collect news article data related to climate change, identify issues utilizing text mining, and see complex information through the detailed analysis considering the characteristics of the text. We crawled news related to climate change issues and analyzed related keywords in terms of cause, result (phenomenon), and response. First, we extracted news related to climate change by using keyword-based document extraction method and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)-based document extraction method. In addition, we propose four related keyword analysis methods using Word2Vec, which is one of word embedding methods, and keyword frequency based method.

Using machine learning in control systems was first suggested in the 1990s, but is more recently being implemented. In this thesis, an embedded climate system, which is a type of control system, will be looked at. The ways in which machine learning can be used to replicate portions of the climate system is looked at. Deep Belief Networks are the machine learning models of choice. Firstly, the functionality of a PID controller is replicated using a Deep Belief Network. Then, the functionality of a more complex control path is replicated. The performance of the Deep Belief Networks are evaluated at how they compare to the original control portions, and the performance in hardware. It is found that the Deep Belief Network can quite accurately replicate the behaviour of a PID controller, whilst the performance is worse for the more complex control path. It was seen that the use of delays in input features gave better results than without. A climate system with a Deep Belief Network was also loaded onto hardware. The minimum requirements of memory usage and CPU usage were met. However, the CPU usage was greatly affected, and if this was to be used in practice, work should be done to decrease it.",2021,2021/12/3 14:50,2021/12/3 14:50,2021/12/3 14:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,www.diva-portal.org,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/W2DC7YTV/Josefsson - 2021 - Modeling an Embedded Climate System Using Machine .pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/RUXTCZ6A/record.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With more than 70% of the world population expected to be living in cities by 2050, ensuring the resilience of urban infrastructure systems under CID is crucial. The present work employs data analytics and machine learning techniques to develop a performance prediction framework for infrastructure systems under CID. The framework encompasses four stages related to: extracting meaningful information about the impact of CID on infrastructure systems and identifying the latter's performance; investigating the relationship between different CID attributes and previously identified system performance; employing data imputation using unsupervised machine learning techniques; and developing and testing a supervised machine learning model based on the different influencing CID attributes. To demonstrate its application, the developed framework is applied to disaster data compiled by the National Weather Services between 1996 and 2019 in the state of New York. The analysis results showed that: i) power systems in New York are the most vulnerable infrastructure to CID, and particularly to wind-related hazards; ii) power system performance level depends on hazard-system interactions rather than solely hazard characteristics; and iii) a 4-predictors random forest-based model can effectively predict power system performance with an accuracy of 89%.

Their results, published in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>, fill a longstanding gap in methane cycle research and will help climate scientists better assess the extent of human perturbations. The study is part of Weber's effort to use data science to better understand how various greenhouse gases, including nitrogen and carbon dioxide, affect global climate systems.</p> <p><strong>MINDING THE METHANE BUDGET</strong></p> <p>Every three years, an international group of climate scientists called the Global Carbon Project updates what is known as the methane budget. The methane budget reflects the current state of understanding of the inputs and outputs in the global methane cycle. It was last updated in 2016.</p> <p>""The methane budget helps us place human methane emissions in context and provides a baseline against which to assess future changes,"" Weber says. ""In past methane budgets, the ocean has been a very uncertain term. We know the ocean naturally releases methane to the atmosphere, but we don't necessarily know how much.""</p> <p>In the methane budget, if one term is uncertain, it adds uncertainty to all the other terms, and limits researchers' ability to predict how the global methane system might change. For that reason, coming up with a more accurate estimate of oceanic methane emissions has been an important goal of methane cycle research for many years.</p> 						<!-- BEGIN mobile-middle-rectangle --> 						<div class=""mobile-middle-rectangle hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg"">				 							<div class=""textrule""> 							   <span>advertisement</span> 							</div> 							<!-- /1002721/ScienceDaily_Mobile_Middle_Rectangle --> 							<div id=""adslot-mobile-middle-rectangle""> 								<script type=""text/javascript""> 									googletag.cmd.push(function() {  										deployads.push(function() { deployads.gpt.display(""adslot-mobile-middle-rectangle"") });  									}); 								</script> 							</div>				 							<hr class=""hrrule""> 						</div> 						<!-- END mobile-middle-rectangle --> <p>But, Weber says, ""it's not easy.""

These models were able to recognize systematic patterns in the methane data, allowing the researchers to predict what the emissions are likely to be, even in regions where no direct observations have been made.</p> <p>""Our approach allowed us to pin down the global ocean emission rate much more accurately than ever before,"" Weber says.</p> <p>The newest version of the methane budget will be released later this year and incorporates the results from Weber's paper, giving researchers a better understanding of how methane cycles throughout the earth's system.</p> 					<!-- BEGIN mobile-bottom-rectangle --> 					<div class=""mobile-bottom-rectangle hidden-sm hidden-md hidden-lg"">				 						<div class=""textrule""> 						   <span>advertisement</span> 						</div> 						<!-- /1002721/ScienceDaily_Mobile_Bottom_Rectangle --> 						<div id=""adslot-mobile-bottom-rectangle""> 							<script type=""text/javascript""> 								googletag.cmd.push(function() {  									deployads.push(function() { deployads.gpt.display(""adslot-mobile-bottom-rectangle"") });  								}); 							</script> 						</div>				 						<hr class=""hrrule""> 					</div> 					<!-- END mobile-bottom-rectangle --> <p><strong>WHERE ARE OCEAN METHANE EMISSIONS MOST CONCENTRATED?</strong></p> <p>In addition to contributing to a better understanding of the global methane budget, the research yielded two other interesting findings:</p> <p>-First, very shallow coastal waters contribute around 50 percent of the total methane emissions from the ocean, despite making up only 5 percent of the ocean area. That's because methane can seep out of natural gas reservoirs along continental margins and can be produced biologically in anoxic (oxygen-depleted) sediments at the seafloor. In deep waters, methane is likely to be oxidized as it travels its long route from the seafloor to the atmosphere. But in shallow waters, there's a rapid route to the atmosphere and methane escapes before it is oxidized. Weber is currently collaborating with John Kessler, a professor of earth and environmental sciences at Rochester, to resolve the remaining uncertainties in coastal methane emissions by conducting research cruises and further developing machine learning models.</p> <p>-Second, methane exhibits a spatial pattern very similar to that of phytoplankton abundance, which supports a controversial recent hypothesis that plankton produces methane in the surface ocean. Previously, scientists believed methane could only be produced in the anoxic conditions found at the bottom of the ocean. ""Evidence is gradually accumulating to overturn that paradigm, and our paper adds an important piece,"" Weber says.</p> <p>Each natural source of methane is likely sensitive to climate change as well, and it is important for researchers to have an accurate baseline.</p> <p>""There are a number of reasons to believe that the ocean might become a larger source of methane in the future, but unless we have a good estimate of how much it emits right now, we'll never be to identify those future changes,"" Weber says.</p> </div> <div class=""impact-unit-wrapper""> 	<div class=""pgs-dpg-flex"" data-pgs-partner-id=""sciencedaily""> 		<div class=""pre-content""> 			<div class=""textrule""> 				<span>make a difference: sponsored opportunity</span> 			</div> 			<div class=""impact-unit""></div> 		</div> 		<div class=""post-content""> 		</div> 	</div> 	<script async="""" type=""text/JavaScript"" src=""https://assets.publicgood.com/pgm/v1/dpg.js""></script> </div> 						<hr> <div id=""story_source"">							<p><strong>Story Source:</strong></p> 							<p>Materials provided by <a href=""http://www.rochester.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>University of Rochester</strong></a>. <em>Note: Content may be edited for style and length.</em></p> </div> <!-- /story_source --> 				 						<hr> <!-- /related_multimedia --> 						<div id=""journal_references""><p><strong>Journal Reference</strong>:</p> <ol class=""journal""> <li>Thomas Weber, Nicola A.

One of the newest and most common types of these algorithms is cluster-led machine learning, which provides bibliographical and textual analysis of scientific papers in the form of interfaces and software such as VOS Viewer. The present article has been compiled as a promotional review study by the method of library and documentary research to explain this algorithm and the way of using the relevant software in the textual analysis of the articles.

Long periods of leaf wetness under warm temperature can trigger damaging plant disease outbreaks. One of the major challenges for monitoring and early warning of crop diseases is obtaining accurate leaf wetness duration (LWD) information. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of combing machine learning techniques with climate reanalysis datasets to improve estimations of site-specific leaf wetness duration. We use random forest (RF) model, long short-term memory (LSTM) model, simple feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) model, and the widely used classification and regression tree (CART) model for estimating leaf wetness duration. The three machine learning models are trained and cross-validated with the hourly surface and near surface variables from climate reanalysis datasets, ERA-5 and MERRA-2, and in situ observations of hourly leaf wetness from 9 stations in Alabama and 6 stations in California over three years. The results indicate that three machine learning methods consistently show better performance than the widely used CART method for estimating LWD in terms of root mean square error in daily timescale. While the machine learning models are not highly sensitive to the climate reanalysis datasets, using ERA-5 shows slightly better accuracy than using MERRA-2 for estimating LWD. In comparison with the baseline CART method which considers dew point deficit, air temperature, wind speed and relative humidity, the machine learning methods employ relevant auxiliary variables from ERA-5 or MERRA-2 datasets (such as net solar radiation, leaf area index, and potential evapotranspiration) which makes them more capable in the estimation of leaf wetness duration. This study suggests that combining machine learning techniques with the state-of-art climate reanalysis data can better estimate LWD compared to the conventional methods, and is particularly valuable in instances when there is no in situ observation data available. The developed new methods for estimating LWD contribute to a step towards climate-smart plant disease monitoring and early warning.",2019/12/1,2021/12/3 14:52,2021/12/3 14:52,2021/12/3 14:52,GC23G-1422,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2019AGUFMGC23G1422A,,,,,0402 Agricultural systems; 1630 Impacts of global change; 1632 Land cover change; 1640 Remote sensing; BIOGEOSCIENCES; GLOBAL CHANGE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This depends on how two opposing C-fluxes—influx from net primary production (NPP) and efflux from heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh)—respond to covariation in temperature and precipitation. There is scant evidence to judge whether field experiments which manipulate both temperature and precipitation align with Earth System Models, or not. As a result, even though the world is generally greening, whether the resultant gains in NPP can offset climate change impacts on Rh, where, and by how much, remains uncertain. Here, we use decadal-scale global time-series datasets on NPP, Rh, temperature, and precipitation to estimate the two opposing C-fluxes and address whether one can outpace the other. We implement machine-learning tools on recent (2001–2019) and near-future climate scenarios (2020–2040) to assess the response of both C-fluxes to temperature and precipitation variation. We find that changes in C-influx may not compensate for C-efflux, particularly in wetter and warmer conditions. Soil-C loss can occur in both tropics and at high latitudes since C-influx from NPP can fall behind C-efflux from Rh. Precipitation emerges as the key determinant of soil-C vulnerability in a warmer world, implying that hotspots for soil-C loss/gain can shift rapidly and highlighting that soil-C is vulnerable to climate change despite widespread greening of the world. The direction of covariation between change in temperature and precipitation, rather than their magnitude, can help conceptualize highly variable patterns in C-fluxes to guide soil-C stewardship.",2021,2021/12/3 14:54,2021/12/3 14:54,2021/12/3 14:54,2029-2038,,10,27,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/gcb.15531,,,,,carbon sequestration; machine-learning; microbial decomposition; primary production; soil organic matter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, reliable and accurate models to parameterize unresolved and under-resolved physics, such as atmospheric convection, remain an important requirement for simulating climate systems. Recently, Machine Learning has proven to be successful in many data-driven tasks, including in mimicking distributions of processes in complex systems using a flavor of deep neural networks called generative adversarial networks (GANs). GANs have also been designed to generate solutions of PDEs governing complex systems without having to numerically solve these PDEs, by using examples from hi-fidelity simulations or experimental data as training data. We present a physics-informed generative adversarial network, i.e., GANs that incorporate constraints of both conservation laws and certain statistical properties obtained from the training data (hi-fidelity simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection). By training both standard GANs and physics-informed GANs as emulators of Rayleigh-Benard convection, we show that the physics-informed GAN is more robust and better captures high-order statistics.

The trained model is extremely fast to run, allowing us to estimate simulation outcomes for thousands of different building designs in seconds. Recent studies have shown the diverse benefits for sustainable building design. Surrogates were applied to provide rapid feedback at the early design stage, to accelerate sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis and design optimization, or to improve building model calibration. However, the current process of surrogate modelling offers much room for improvement. In particular, a surrogate model is bound to the specific building design problem it has been trained for. This includes a specific site, requiring time-intensive retraining if the building performance at another location is to be analysed. In this paper, we develop a single surrogate model that spans arbitrarily many locations. For that purpose, we are among the first to use a deep temporal convolutional neural network to process annual multivariate weather data with hourly resolution (≈150,000 inputs). The network learns features relevant to estimate heating or cooling demand. We combine these location-specific weather features with building design parameters to serve as input to a single surrogate model (feed-forward neural network).

Due to mounting economic losses that globally averaged USD44 billion from 2000-2016, and to the complexity of insuring flood, insurers can themselves purchase insurance, known as reinsurance, to manage economic flood risk. Reinsurance is grounded in the expectation of perfect spatial diversification; that is, only a small part of a portfolio of insured properties sufficiently distant from one another will be subject to a flood in the same year. However, climate oscillations and concentration of wealth may impede the ability of purely spatial considerations to sufficiently diversify portfolios. Spatial diversification of flood risk is thought to be increasingly effective over larger and larger spatial scales, and hence the global-scale is a natural spatial scale for such problems. Recent developments in hydrological modeling have provided important advances in assessing flood and its climatic drivers. However, such physical models require high spatial and temporal resolution, and are thus currently not appropriate for risk management, which typically operates in terms of loss distributions of thousands of years of simulated flood events. To engage this problem, we have designed a large-scale flood modeling framework based on a machine learning technique that pairs a flood event database with a large ensemble of climate simulations. We employed the Dartmouth Flood Observatory global flood event database to associate flood impact measures to catchments based on the HydroSHEDS database, and characterized each catchment with a variety of hydrological and climate forcing variables. To explore the global spatial features of flood risk, we forced the flood model with climate data from the CESM Large Ensemble, an ensemble of 40 members of the NCAR CESM1 global climate model of the years 1920-2100. We present and discuss the resulting set of simulated floods. This model framework will allow us to explore a number of hypotheses, such as test the spatial diversification hypothesis for flood risk, quantify the role of climate oscillations and climate change, and determine to what extent concentration of population and wealth affect flood risk management.",2018/12/1,2021/12/3 14:55,2021/12/3 14:55,2021/12/3 14:55,H51B-07,,,2018,,,Flood risk management through spatial diversification at the global scale,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2018AGUFM.H51B..07B,,,,,3354 Precipitation; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSESDE: 1821 Floods; HYDROLOGYDE: 1855 Remote sensing; HYDROLOGYDE: 4335 Disaster management; NATURAL HAZARDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some studies have proposed modified RF and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches. This study aims to compare CNN with an RF classifier for LCZ mapping in great detail. We designed five schemes (three RF-based schemes (S1–S3) and two CNN-based ones (S4–S5)), which consist of various combinations of input features from bitemporal Landsat 8 data over four global mega cities: Rome, Hong Kong, Madrid, and Chicago. Among the five schemes, the CNN-based one with the incorporation of a larger neighborhood information showed the best classification performance. When compared to the WUDAPT workflow, the overall accuracies for entire land cover classes (OA) and for urban LCZ types (i.e., LCZ1-10; OAurb) increased by about 6–8% and 10–13%, respectively, for the four cities. The transferability of LCZ models for the four cities were evaluated, showing that CNN consistently resulted in higher accuracy (increased by about 7–18% and 18–29% for OA and OAurb, respectively) than RF. This study revealed that the CNN classifier classified particularly well for the specific LCZ classes in which buildings were mixed with trees or buildings or plants were sparsely distributed.

Twenty flood-risk factors were selected to model flood risk using several machine learning techniques: conditional inference random forest (CIRF), the gradient boosting model (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and their ensembles. To investigate the future (year 2050) effects of changing climates and changing land use on future flood risk, a general circulation model (GCM) with representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of the 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios by 2050 was tested for impacts on 8 precipitation variables.

The performances of the flood risk models were validated with Receiver Operating Characteristic-Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC) and other statistical analyses. The AUC value of the ROC curve indicates that the ensemble model had the highest predictive power (AUC = 0.83) and was followed by GBM (AUC = 0.80), XGB (AUC = 0.79), and CIRF (AUC = 0.78). The results of climate and land use changes on future flood-prone areas showed that the areas classified as having moderate to very high flood risk will increase by 2050.

In recent years, due to the rapid development of data science, Machine learning (ML) parameterizations for convection and clouds have been proven the potential to perform better than conventional parameterizations. At present, most of the existing studies are on aqua-planet and idealized models, and the problems of simulated instability and climate drift still exist. In realistic configurated models, developing a machine learning parameterization scheme remains a challenging task. In this study, a group of deep residual multilayer perceptrons with strong nonlinear fitting ability is designed to learn a parameterization scheme from cloud-resolving model outputs. Multi-target training is achieved to best balance the fits across diverse neural network outputs. The optimal machine learning parameterization, named NN-Parameterization, is further chosen among feasible candidates for both high performance and long-term simulation. The results show that NN-Parameterization performs well in multi-year climate simulations and reproduces reasonable climatology and climate variability in a general circulation model (GCM), with a running speed of about 30 times faster than the cloud-resolving model embedded Superparameterizated GCM. Under real geographical boundary conditions, the hybrid ML-physical GCM well simulates the spatial distribution of precipitation and significantly improves the frequency of precipitation extremes, which is largely underestimated in the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5) with the horizontal resolution of 1.9&deg;&thinsp;&times;&thinsp;2.5&deg;. Furthermore, the hybrid ML-physical GCM simulates a stronger signal of the Madden-Julian oscillation with a more reasonable propagation speed, which is too weak and propagates too fast in CAM5. This study is a pioneer to achieve multi-year stable climate simulations using a hybrid ML-physical GCM in actual land-ocean boundary conditions. It demonstrates the emerging potential for using machine learning parameterizations in climate simulations.</p>",2021/9/29,2021/12/3 14:58,2021/12/3 14:58,2021/12/3 14:58,1-35,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,gmd.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/9P8HPNN6/Wang et al. - 2021 - Stable climate simulations using a realistic GCM w.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving the forecasting accuracy is aimed at solving the problem of determining the water reserve for the future generation of electricity at hydroelectric power plants, taking into account the regulation in the medium term. Medium-term regulation is necessary to amplify the load in the peak and semi-peak portions of the load curve. The solution to such problems is aggravated by the lack of sufficiently reliable information on water inflow and prospective power consumption, which is of a stochastic nature. In addition, the mid-term planning of electricity generation should consider the seasonality of changes in water inflow, which directly affects the reserves and the possibility of regulation. The paper considers the problem of constructing a model for medium-term forecasting of water inflow for planning electricity generation, taking into account climatic changes in isolated power systems. Taking into account the regularly increasing effect of climate change, the current study proposes using an approach based on machine learning methods, which are distinguished by a high degree of autonomy and automation of learning, that is, the ability to self-adapt. The results showed that the error (RMSE) of the model based on the ensemble of regression decision trees due to constant self-adaptation decreased from 4.5 m3/s to 4.0 m3/s and turned out to be lower than the error of a more complex multilayer recurrent neural network (4.9 m3/s).

In this context, the linear inverse modeling (LIM) approach, by capturing a few essential interactions between dynamical components of the full system, has proven valuable in providing insights into predictability of the full system. We demonstrate that reservoir computing (RC), a form of learning suitable for systems with chaotic dynamics, provides an alternative nonlinear approach that improves on the predictive skill of the LIM approach. We do this in the example setting of predicting sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic in the preindustrial control simulation of a popular earth system model, the Community Earth System Model so that we can compare the performance of the new RC-based approach with the traditional LIM approach both when learning data are plentiful and when such data are more limited. The improved predictive skill of the RC approach over a wide range of conditions—larger number of retained EOF coefficients, extending well into the limited data regime, etc.—suggests that this machine-learning technique may have a use in climate predictability studies. While the possibility of developing a climate emulator—the ability to continue the evolution of the system on the attractor long after failing to be able to track the reference trajectory—is demonstrated in the Lorenz-63 system, it is suggested that further development of the RC approach may permit such uses of the new approach in more realistic predictability studies.",2021,2021/12/3 14:58,2021/12/3 14:58,2021/12/3 14:58,e2020MS002290,,4,13,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020MS002290,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/5H37BL7K/Nadiga - 2021 - Reservoir Computing as a Tool for Climate Predicta.pdf,,,climate; echo state networks; linear inverse modeling; machine learning; predictability; reservoir computing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The boosted regression trees (BRT) model, a nonlinear machine learning method, was used to explore the complex relationship between tree-ring growth and climate factors on a larger spatial scale. The common pattern of an asymptotic growth response to the climate indicated that the climate-growth relationship may be linear until a certain threshold. Once beyond this threshold, tree growth will be insensitive to some climate factors, after which a nonlinear relationship may occur. Spring and autumn climate factors are important controls of tree growth in most study areas. General circulation model (GCM) projections of future climates suggest that warming climates, especially temperatures in excess of those of the optimum growth threshold (as estimated by BRT), will be particularly threatening to the adaptation of Masson pine.",3月-19,2021/12/3 14:58,2021/12/3 14:58,2021/12/3 14:58,228,,3,10,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/ZP6XSQDT/Gu et al. - 2019 - Insights into the BRT (Boosted Regression Trees) M.pdf,,,<i>Pinus massoniana</i> Lamb.; boosted regression trees; general circulation model; nonlinear; subtropical area; tree ring,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We use the relatively simple general circulation models (GCMs) PUMA and PLASIM as a simplified reality on which we train deep neural networks, which we then use for predicting the model weather at lead times of a few days. We specifically assess how the complexity of the climate model affects the neural network's forecast skill and how dependent the skill is on the length of the provided training period.

Predictive models that automatically capture trends between climate and diseases are likely to be beneficial in minimizing disease outbreaks.

Such manual tuning significantly limits the full potential of ML methods, especially for high-dimensional and complex task domains, as typified by real-world health-care application data-sets. Additionally, the inaccessibility of many health-care data-sets compounds innate problems of method comparison, predictive accuracy and the overall advancement of ML based health-care applications.

We found that improved agricultural technology and country fixed effects are three times more important than climate variables for explaining changes in crop yields in SSA. We also found that increasing temperatures reduced yields for all three crops in the temperature range observed in SSA, while precipitation increased yields up to a level roughly matching crop evapotranspiration. Crop yields exhibited both linear and nonlinear responses to temperature and precipitation, respectively. For maize, technology steadily increased yields by about 1% (13 kg/ha) per year while increasing temperatures decreased yields by 0.8% (10 kg/ha) per °C.

A key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC for complex systems such as buildings is related to the difficulties (cost, time and effort) associated with the identification of a predictive model of a building. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel idea for predictive control based on historical building data leveraging machine learning algorithms like regression trees and random forests. We call this approach Data-driven model Predictive Control (DPC), and we apply it to three different case studies to demonstrate its performance, scalability and robustness. In the first case study we consider a benchmark MPC controller using a bilinear building model, then we apply DPC to a data-set simulated from such bilinear model and derive a controller based only on the data. Our results demonstrate that DPC can provide comparable performance with respect to MPC applied to a perfectly known mathematical model. In the second case study we apply DPC to a 6 story 22 zone building model in EnergyPlus, for which model-based control is not economical and practical due to extreme complexity, and address a Demand Response problem. Our results demonstrate scalability and efficiency of DPC showing that DPC provides the desired power curtailment with an average error of 3%. In the third case study we implement and test DPC on real data from an off-grid house located in L’Aquila, Italy. We compare the total amount of energy saved with respect to the classical bang-bang controller, showing that we can perform an energy saving up to 49.2%.

Predicted results of the model considering the water change not only can highly improve the model performance (with higher R2), but also can simulate the drought in Europe and the more intense ETa in Africa. Thus, Er proposed in this study provide a good reference for regional ETa except for ETp.

Knowledge about flood generating processes improves hydrological models, flood frequency analysis, estimation of climate change impact on floods, etc. Yet, not much is known about how climate and catchment attributes influence the spatial distribution of flood generating processes. This study aims to offer a comprehensive and structured approach to close this knowledge gap. We employ a large sample approach (671 catchments across the contiguous United States) and evaluate how catchment attributes and climate attributes influence the distribution of flood processes. We use two complementary approaches: A statistics-based approach which compares attribute frequency distributions of different flood processes; and a random forest model in combination with an interpretable machine learning approach (accumulated local effects [ALE]). The ALE method has not been used often in hydrology, and it overcomes a significant obstacle in many statistical methods, the confounding effect of correlated catchment attributes. As expected, we find climate attributes (fraction of snow, aridity, precipitation seasonality, and mean precipitation) to be most influential on flood process distribution. However, the influence of catchment attributes varies both with flood generating process and climate type.

There are increasing concerns with respect to how to integrate multi-source data and employ machine learning techniques to establish a simple, timely, and accurate crop yield prediction model at an administrative unit. Many previous studies were mainly focused on the whole crop growth period through expensive manual surveys, remote sensing, or climate data. However, the effect of selecting different time window on yield prediction was still unknown. Thus, we separated the whole growth period into four time windows and assessed their corresponding predictive ability by taking the major winter wheat production regions of China as an example in the study. Firstly we developed a modeling framework to integrate climate data, remote sensing data and soil data to predict winter wheat yield based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The results show that the models can accurately predict yield 1~2 months before the harvesting dates at the county level in China with an R2 &gt; 0.75 and yield error less than 10%. Support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and random forest (RF) represent the top three best methods for predicting yields among the eight typical machine learning models tested in this study. In addition, we also found that different agricultural zones and temporal training settings affect prediction accuracy.

This study designs and evaluates a soft-computing drought modelling framework in context of Pakistan, a drought-stricken nation, by means of a committee extreme learning machine (Comm-ELM) model in respect to a committee particle swarm optimization-adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (Comm-PSO-ANFIS) and committee multiple linear regression (Comm-MLR) model applied to forecast monthly standardized precipitation index (SPI). The proposed Comm-ELM model incorporates historical monthly rainfall, temperature, humidity, Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) at monthly lag (t − 1) and the respective month (i.e., periodicity factor) as the explanatory variable for the drought’s behaviour defined by SPI. The model accuracy is assessed by root mean squared error, mean absolute error, correlation coefficient, Willmott’s index, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and Legates McCabe’s index in the independent test dataset. With the incorporation of periodicity as an input factor, the performance of the Comm-ELM model for Islamabad, Multan and Dera Ismail Khan (D. I. Khan) as the test stations, was remarkably improved in respect to the Comm-PSO-ANFIS and Comm-MLR model. Other than the superiority of Comm-ELM over the alternative models tested for monthly SPI forecasting, we also highlight the importance of the periodicity cycle as a pertinent predictor variable in a drought forecasting model. The results ascertain that the model accuracy scales with geographic factors, due to the complexity of drought phenomenon and its relationship with the different inputs and data attributes that can affect the overall evolution of a drought event.

By identifying spatial patterns that serve as indicators of change in surface temperature and precipitation, the ANN can determine the approximate year from which the simulations came without first explicitly separating the forced signal from the noise of both internal climate variability and model uncertainty. Thus, the ANN indicator patterns are complex, nonlinear combinations of signal and noise and are identified from the 1960s onward in simulated and observed surface temperature maps.

We tested hypotheses based on this assumption using survey responses from 508 European forest professionals in ten countries. We used the survey results to identify communication needs and the decision strategies at play, and to develop guidelines on adequate communications about climate change adaptation. We observed polarization in the positive and negative values associated with climate change impacts accepted by survey respondents. We identified a mechanism creating the polarization that we call the ‘blocked belief’ effect. We found that polarized values did not correlate with decisions about climate change adaptation. Strong belief in the local impacts of climate change on the forest was, however, a prerequisite of decision-making favoring adaptation. Decision-making in favor of adaptation to climate change also correlated with net values of expected specific impacts on the forest and generally increased with the absolute value of these in the absence of ‘tipping point’ behavior. Tipping point behavior occurs when adaptation is not pursued in spite of the strongly negative or positive net value of expected climate change impacts. We observed negative and positive tipping point behavior, mainly in SW Europe and N-NE Europe, respectively. In addition we found that advice on effective adaptation may inhibit adaptation when the receiver is aware of effective adaptation measures unless it is balanced with information explaining how climate change leads to negative impacts. Forest professionals with weak expectations of impacts require communications on climate change and its impacts on forests before any advice on adaptation measures can be effective. We develop evidence-based guidelines on communications using a new methodology which includes Bayesian machine learning modeling of the equivalent of an expected utility function for the adaptation decision problem.",11月-20,2021/12/3 15:04,2021/12/3 15:04,2021/12/3 15:04,114061,,11,15,,Environ.

S9E5C2DY,thesis,2021,"Schlund, Manuel",Constraining Uncertainties in Multi-Model Projections of the Future Climate with Observations,,,,,https://media.suub.uni-bremen.de/handle/elib/5144,"Earth system models (ESMs) are common tools to project climate change. The main focus of this thesis is the analysis of climate projections from ESMs participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) with the aim to reduce uncertainties in climate projections with observations. In a first step, climate sensitivity is evaluated in CMIP6 models. For the effective climate sensitivity (ECS), a multi-model range of 1.8-5.6 K is found. This range is higher than in any previous CMIP ensemble before. Possible reasons for this are changes in cloud parameterizations. To reduce uncertainties in the ECS of the CMIP6 models, 11 published emergent constraints on ECS are analyzed. Emergent constraints are approaches to reduce uncertainties in climate projections by combining observations and ESM output. The application of the emergent constraints to CMIP6 data shows a decrease in the skill of the emergent relationships. This is likely related to the increased multi-model spread of ECS in CMIP6, but may in some cases also be due to spurious statistical relationships. The results support previous studies concluding that emergent constraints should be based on independently verifiable physical mechanisms. To overcome these issues of emergent constraints, an alternative approach based on machine learning (ML) is introduced. As target variable, gross primary production (GPP) is studied. In a first step, an existing emergent constraint is used to constrain the global mean GPP at the end of the 21st century in Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 simulations with CMIP5 ESMs to (171 ± 12) GtC yr-1. In a second step, an ML model is used to constrain gridded future absolute GPP. For this, observational data is fed into the ML algorithm that has been trained on CMIP5 data to learn relationships between present-day physically relevant diagnostics and the target variable. In a perfect model setup, the ML model shows superior performance.",2021/8/2,2021/12/3 15:04,2021/12/3 15:04,2021/12/3 15:04,,174,,,,,,,,,,Universität Bremen,,en,cc_by,thesis,,,elib.dlr.de,,DOI: 10.26092/elib/941,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/25JGJPAM/Schlund - 2021 - Constraining Uncertainties in Multi-Model Projecti.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While various bias correction methods have been developed to post-process model outputs to match observations, existing approaches usually focus on limited, low-order statistics, or break either the spatiotemporal consistency of the target variable, or its dependency upon model resolved dynamics. We develop a Regularized Adversarial Domain Adaptation (RADA) methodology to overcome these deficiencies, and enhance efficient identification and correction of climate model biases. Instead of pre-assuming the spatiotemporal characteristics of model biases, we apply discriminative neural networks to distinguish historical climate simulation samples and observation samples. The evidences based on which the discriminative neural networks make distinctions are applied to train the domain adaptation neural networks to bias correct climate simulations. We regularize the domain adaptation neural networks using cycle-consistent statistical and dynamical constraints. An application to daily precipitation projection over the contiguous United States shows that our methodology can correct all the considered moments of daily precipitation at approximately resolution, ensures spatiotemporal consistency and inter-field correlations, and can discriminate between different dynamical conditions.

The purpose of this study is to explore the means of making HVAC systems respond automatically to local occupant temperature preferences. To create an occupant-centric indoor temperature environment, we propose an online-learning-based control strategy together with its design process. Four essential variables from four domains—time, indoor and outdoor climates, and occupant behavior—are extracted to construct datasets for preference models. A neural network algorithm and corresponding hyperparameters are suggested to model temperature preferences. According to time-dependent setpoints learned from dynamic contexts, a set of specified rules is used to determine setpoints for HVAC systems.

However, there is no denying that coal, oil and gas still constitute the major source of energy worldwide by far, and humanity will be dependent on them still for decades. As a matter of fact, the global demand of fossil fuels is still increasing rather than decreasing. However, fossil resources are consumed at a much higher rate than they are generated. Only focusing on crude oil, the chances of finding new conventional reservoirs are nowadays low, and this conventional sources are quickly depleting, therefore it is necessary to turn more and more the attention to unconventional sources, such as carbonate reservoirs, tar sands, oil shales and deep off-shore reservoirs. Chemical enhanced oil recovery (cEOR) techniques are already well established in improving macroscopic and microscopic oil displacement, increasing oil production after primary and secondary methods are exhausted. However, these are mostly implemented in reservoirs that normally possess favorable conditions. Research can still contribute in making these processes more efficient and sustainable, especially for unconventional oil, for as long as we will need to extract fossil fuels. After supporting the idea that exploitation of fossil resources cannot stop just yet, this perspective article will highlight recent advances in the field of cEOR, mentioning new developments in traditional methods, such as polymer and surfactant flooding, as well as newer methods, such as nanoparticles, preformed particle gels, and smart waterflooding, plus the various possible new combinations (hybrid EOR). This paper will finally try to shortly outline future directions of cEOR research, with emphasis on sustainable methods, such as CO2 flooding combined with carbon capture and storage strategies, and newly available research tools, such as reservoir-on-a-chip and machine learning.",2021/11/23,2021/12/3 15:05,2021/12/3 15:05,2021/12/3 15:05,,,,,,MRS Communications,Where is research on fossil fuels going in times of climate change?,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The climate and yield data used was for a period of 36 years between 1980 and 2015. Similar to the observed decrease (P < 0.001) in rice yield, pan evaporation, solar radiation, and wind speed declined significantly. Eight principal components exhibited an eigenvalue > 1 and explained 83.1% of the total variance of predictor variables. The SVM regression function using the scores of the first principal component explained about 75% of the variance in rice yield data and linear regression about 64%. SVM regression between annual solar radiation values and yield explained 67% of the variance. Only the first component of the principal component analysis (PCA) exhibited a clear long-term trend and sometimes short-term variance similar to that of rice yield. Short-term fluctuations of the scores of the PC1 are closely coupled to those of rice yield during the 1986–1993 and the 2006–2013 periods thereby revealing the inter-annual sensitivity of rice production to climate variability. Solar radiation stands out as the climate variable of highest influence on rice yield, and the influence was especially strong during monsoon and post-monsoon periods, which correspond to the vegetative, booting, flowering, and grain filling stages in the study area. The outcome is expected to provide more in-depth regional-specific climate-rice linkage for screening of better cultivars that can positively respond to future climate fluctuations as well as providing information that may help optimized planting dates for improved radiation use efficiency in the study area.",2018/3/1,2021/12/3 15:05,2021/12/3 15:05,2021/12/3 15:05,459-469,,3,62,,Int J Biometeorol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many drought indices have been developed to characterize agricultural drought, relying on either ground-based climate data or various remotely-sensed drought proxies. Ground-based drought indices are more accurate but limited in coverage, while remote sensing drought indices cover large areas but have poor precision. Application of advanced data fusion approaches based on remotely-sensed data to estimate ground-based drought indices may help fill this gap. The overall objective of this study was to determine whether various remotely-sensed drought factors could be effectively used for monitoring agricultural drought in south-eastern Australia. In this study, thirty remotely-sensed drought factors from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors were used to reproduce a ground-based drought index, SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index) during 2001–2017 for the New South Wales wheat belt in south-eastern Australia. Three advanced machine learning methods, i.e. bias-corrected random forest, support vector machine, and multi-layer perceptron neural network, were adopted as the regression models in this procedure. A station-based historical climate dataset and observed wheat yields were used as reference data to evaluate the performance of the model-predicted SPEI in reflecting agricultural drought. Results show that the bias-corrected random forest model outperformed the other two models for SPEI prediction, as quantified by the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (<0.28 and ~0.9, respectively). Drought distribution maps produced by the bias-corrected random forest model were then compared with the station-based drought maps, showing strong visual and statistical agreement. Furthermore, the model-predicted SPEI values were more highly correlated with observed wheat yields than the station-based SPEI. The method used in this study is effective and fast, and based on data that are readily available. It can be easily extended to other cropping areas to produce a rapid overview of drought conditions and to enhance the present capabilities of real-time drought monitoring.",2019/7/1,2021/12/3 15:05,2021/12/3 15:05,2021/12/3 15:05,303-316,,,173,,Agricultural Systems,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Agricultural drought; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study used a fusion-based framework for meteorological drought modeling for the historical (1983–2016) and future (2020–2050) periods using remotely sensed datasets versus ground-based observations and climate change scenarios. To this aim, high-resolution remotely sensed precipitation datasets, including PERSIANN-CDR and CHIRPS (multi-source products), ERA5 (reanalysis datasets), and GPCC (gauge-interpolated datasets), were employed to estimate non-parametric SPI (nSPI) as a meteorological drought index against local observations. For more accurate drought evaluation, all stations were classified into different clusters using the K-means clustering algorithm based on ground-based nSPI. Then, four Individual Artificial Intelligence (IAI) models, including Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and General Regression Neural Network (GRNN), were developed for drought modeling within each cluster. Finally, two advanced fusion-based methods, including Multi-Model Super Ensemble (MMSE) as a linear weighted model and a nonlinear model called machine learning Random Forest (RF), combined results by IAI models using different remotely sensed datasets. The proposed framework was implemented to simulate each remotely sensed precipitation data for the future based on CORDEX regional climate models (RCMs) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for drought projection. The efficiency of IAI and fusion models was evaluated using statistical error metrics, including the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed methodology was employed in the Gavkhooni basin of Iran, and results showed that the RF model with the lowest estimation error (RMSE of 0.391 and R2 of 0.810) had performed well compared to all other models.

Currently, strategies to plan for an upcoming season are based on data from the recent seasons. Current methods to forecasting food production levels and derisk an upcoming season in any given region, are rudimentary and at best, not scalable. The advent of big data and new data sources such as weather forecasts, remote sensing, scalable machine-learning methods and cloud computing has created new opportunities for understanding the impact of an upcoming growing season. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the current data sources and methods, this chapter presents a methodology that combines seasonal weather forecasts, geo-spatial information derived from remote-sensing, risks posed by extreme events and crop growth models to estimate production risk at a regional scale.

Three categories of droughts; moderate, severe, and extreme considering two major cropping seasons called Rabi and Kharif were estimated using Standardized Precipitation Evaporation Index (SPEI) and then predicted using the predictor data obtained from the National Centres for Environmental Prediction/National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis database. Also, for the first time in drought modelling, a novel feature selection approach called Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was used for identifying optimum sets of predictors. In validation, SVM-based models were able to better capture the temporal and spatial characteristics of droughts over Pakistan compared to those by ANN and KNN-based models. KNN which was used in developing drought models for the first time displayed limited performance in comparison to that by SVM and ANN-based drought models, in validation.

The prediction of regional droughts may provide important information for drought preparedness and farm irrigation. The existing drought prediction models are mainly based on a single weather station. Efforts need to be taken to develop a new multistation-based prediction model. Objectives This study optimizes the predictor selection process and develops a new model to predict droughts using past drought index, meteorological measures and climate signals from 32 stations during 1961 to 2016 in Shaanxi province, China. Methods We applied and compared two methods, including a cross-correlation function and a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM), in selecting the optimal predictors and specifying their lag time. Then, we built a DLNM, an artificial neural network model and an XGBoost model and compared their validations for predicting the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) 1–6 months in advance. Results The DLNM was better than the cross-correlation function in predictor selection and lag effect determination. The XGBoost model more accurately predicted SPEI with a lead time of 1–6 months than the DLNM and the artificial neural network, with cross-validation R2 values of 0.68–0.82, 0.72–0.89, 0.81–0.92, and 0.84–0.95 at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month time scales, respectively. Moreover, the XGBoost model had the highest prediction accuracy for overall droughts (89%–97%) and for three specific drought categories (i.e., moderate, severe, and extreme) (76%–94%).

Here, we applied the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to predict the current and future potential distribution of Ulmus wallichiana and U. villosa in Himalayas of Pakistan to provide a basis for its protection and conservation. A total of 353 occurrence points were collected from both species across the study area during 2017–2019. In total, 19 bioclimatic and three topographic variables were used to model the potential distribution area under the current and future scenarios. Predicted suitable habitat layers for Ulmus wallichiana and U. villosa were generated through MaxEnt model. The overall performance of the modeling was positive. Area under the curve values recorded were 0.980 and 0.947 for training data of Ulmus wallichiana and U. villosa. Bio 4 was recorded as the strongest contributor for both the species. The jackknife test illustrated the same variable with highest gain. In the study area, the estimated area of occupancy in the observed localities was about 68 and 156 km2 for Ulmus wallichiana and U. villosa. Nonetheless, the cover area for Ulmus wallichiana and U. villosa as predicted by model will be 45 and 126 km2, respectively. The prediction model illustrated significant depletion in cover as well as in shifting of both the species.

In this study, we used SOC data in a Digital Soil Mapping framework to predict current and future SOC stocks across the state of New South Wales (NSW) in south-eastern Australia. In the first phase of the study we estimated the current SOC stock using multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) modelling, and in the second phase we projected the change of SOC stocks in the near future (2050s) and far future (2090s) under two Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios based on 25 global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Our spatial modelling showed that estimated current SOC stocks in NSW decreased from east to west. Multi-GCM ensemble means suggested SOC stocks would decrease by 7.6–12.9% under SSP2-4.5 and 9.1–20.9% under SSP5-8.5 across NSW under future climate. The extent of change in SOC stocks varied spatially with the largest mean decrease of SOC stocks occurring in the North Coast and South East (alpine) regions of NSW.

The rise of technology and persisting growth of computing devices known as the Internet of Things (IoT) and increasing automation of systems through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) is a factor of energy expenditure as more humans desire devices and more systems are built. The ethical implications of utilizing new technology should be evaluated before creating more. This paper explores modern computing systems in the sectors that draw the most energy, and, more specifically, the role AI and IoT play in them. Each sector may become more energy efficient, productive, and safer by introducing edge computing through IoT devices and coupling it with AI computing abilities that already automate most processes. Multiple studies show energy consumption and costs are lowered when edge computing is paired with the IoT and AI. There is less human involvement, more regularity in execution and performance, and more widespread use because of the accessibility. This creates safer, cheaper, energy-efficient systems that utilize existing technology. The ethical implications of these systems are much more positive than what already exists.

This study investigates the future water availability in the Langtang basin, Central Himalayas, Nepal under climate change scenarios using state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) techniques. The daily snow area for the region was derived from MODIS images. The outputs of climate models were used to project the temperature and precipitation until 2100. Three ML models, including Gated recurrent unit (GRU), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Recurrent neural network (RNN), were developed for snowmelt runoff prediction, and their performance was compared based on statistical indicators. The result suggests that the mean temperature of the basin could rise by 4.98 °C by the end of the century. The annual average precipitation in the basin is likely to increase in the future, especially due to high monsoon rainfall, but winter precipitation could decline. The annual river discharge is projected to upsurge significantly due to increased precipitation and snowmelt, and no shift in hydrograph is expected in the future. Among three ML models, the LSTM model performed better than GRU and RNN models. In summary, this study depicts severe future climate change in the region and quantifies its effect on river discharge.

As the heating and cooling system highly affect the operation cost of buildings; it is worth investigating the development of models to predict the heating and cooling loads of buildings. In contrast to the majority of the existing related studies, which are based on historical energy consumption data, this study considers building characteristics, such as area and floor height, to develop prediction models of heating and cooling loads. In particular, this study proposes deep neural networks models based on several hyper-parameters: the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the learning algorithm. The tuned models are constructed using a dataset generated with the Integrated Environmental Solutions Virtual Environment (IESVE) simulation software for the city of Buraydah city, the capital of the Qassim region in Saudi Arabia. The Qassim region was selected because of its harsh arid climate of extremely cold winters and hot summers, which means that lot of energy is used up for cooling and heating of residential buildings. Through model tuning, optimal parameters of deep learning models are determined using the following performance measures: Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Regression (R) values, and coefficient of determination (R2). The results obtained with the five-layer deep neural network model, with 20 neurons in each layer and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm, outperformed the results of the other models with a lower number of layers.

Since then, the field has rapidly progressed congruently with the wide adoption of machine learning (ML) methods in the environmental sciences. Here, we present a scoping review of ML applications in wildfire science and management. Our overall objective is to improve awareness of ML methods among wildfire researchers and managers, as well as illustrate the diverse and challenging range of problems in wildfire science available to ML data scientists. To that end, we first present an overview of popular ML approaches used in wildfire science to date and then review the use of ML in wildfire science as broadly categorized into six problem domains, including (i) fuels characterization, fire detection, and mapping; (ii) fire weather and climate change; (iii) fire occurrence, susceptibility, and risk; (iv) fire behavior prediction; (v) fire effects; and (vi) fire management. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and limitations of various ML approaches relating to data size, computational requirements, generalizability, and interpretability, as well as identify opportunities for future advances in the science and management of wildfires within a data science context. In total, to the end of 2019, we identified 300 relevant publications in which the most frequently used ML methods across problem domains included random forests, MaxEnt, artificial neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines, and genetic algorithms. As such, there exists opportunities to apply more current ML methods — including deep learning and agent-based learning — in the wildfire sciences, especially in instances involving very large multivariate datasets. We must recognize, however, that despite the ability of ML models to learn on their own, expertise in wildfire science is necessary to ensure realistic modelling of fire processes across multiple scales, while the complexity of some ML methods such as deep learning requires a dedicated and sophisticated knowledge of their application. Finally, we stress that the wildfire research and management communities play an active role in providing relevant, high-quality, and freely available wildfire data for use by practitioners of ML methods.",2020/12/1,2021/12/3 15:13,2021/12/3 15:14,2021/12/3 15:13,478-505,,4,28,,Environ.

Thus, accurate estimation of ET0 is necessary to avoid over or under irrigation to increase agricultural productivity and manage water resources effectively. Due to the limited availability of climate datasets in developing countries, the estimation of ET0 remains the biggest challenge. This study presents two-hybrid deep neural network models for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration: Convolution—Long Short Term Memory (Conv-LSTM), which performs the convolution operation in LSTM cells and Convolution Neural Network—LSTM (CNN-LSTM) that uses the convolution layer for feature extraction of input data and then extracted features are fed to LSTM layers. The study also focuses on climate data scarcity conditions, and thus, different input combinations of climate parameters have been used to investigate the minimum required parameters to model the ET0 process. The climate dataset of two stations of India: Ludhiana and Amritsar, is adopted to develop proposed models. It includes daily maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), wind speed measured at the height of 2 m (U2), solar radiation (Rs), relative humidity (Rh), vapor pressure (Vp), and sunshine hours (Ssh) data from the period 2003 to 2015 of Ludhiana station and 2000 to 2016 of Amritsar station. Several performance measures are used to assess the precision of the model and to perform sensitivity analysis. Temperature and radiation are observed as the prime data inputs required to estimate ET0 values. The proposed hybrid models are then compared with existing temperature and radiation-based empirical models such as Hargreaves, Makkink, and Ritchie.

Several RS-based GPP models have been developed using different criteria, yet the sensitivities to environmental factors vary among models; thus, a comparison of model sensitivity is necessary for analyzing and interpreting results and for choosing suitable models. In this study, we globally evaluated and compared the sensitivities of 14 RS-based models (2 process-, 4 vegetation-index-, 5 light-use-efficiency, and 3 machine-learning-based models) and benchmarked them against GPP responses to climatic factors measured at flux sites and to elevated CO2 concentrations measured at free-air CO2 enrichment experiment sites. The results demonstrated that the models with relatively high sensitivity to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations showed a higher increasing GPP trend. The fundamental difference in the CO2 effect in the models’ algorithm either considers the effect of CO2 through changes in greenness indices (nine models) or introduces the influences on photosynthesis (three models). The overall effects of temperature and radiation, in terms of both magnitude and sign, vary among the models, while the models respond relatively consistently to variations in precipitation. Spatially, larger differences among model sensitivity to climatic factors occur in the tropics; at high latitudes, models have a consistent and obvious positive response to variations in temperature and radiation, and precipitation significantly enhances the GPP in mid-latitudes. Compared with the results calculated by flux-site measurements, the model performance differed substantially among different sites. However, the sensitivities of most models are basically within the confidence interval of the flux-site results. In general, the comparison revealed that models differed substantially in the effect of environmental regulations, particularly CO2 fertilization and water stress, on GPP, and none of the models performed consistently better across the different ecosystems and under the various external conditions.",2019/6/10,2021/12/3 15:14,2021/12/3 15:14,2021/12/3 15:14,696-713,,,668,,Science of The Total Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,CO fertilization effect; Gross primary production; Model sensitivity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing natural-caused fires throughout western United States national forests could place people, property, and infrastructure at risk in the future. We used the fine K nearest neighbor (KNN) method coupled with the downscaled Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) climate dataset to estimate changes in the rate of natural-caused fires in western United States national forests. We projected changes in the rate of minor and major forest fires from historical (1986–2015) to future (2070–2099) conditions to characterize fire-prone national forests under a range of climate change scenarios. The results indicate that climate change can add to the occurrence of forest fires in western United States national forests, particularly in Rocky Mountain, Pacific Southwest, and Southwestern United States Forest Service regions. Although summer months are projected to have the highest rate of natural-caused forest fire activity in the future, the rate of natural-caused forest fires is likely to increase from August to December in the future compared to the historical conditions. Improved understanding of altered forest fire regimes can help forest managers to better understand the potential effects of climate change on future fire activity and implement actions to attenuate possible negative consequences.",8月-21,2021/12/3 15:14,2021/12/3 15:14,2021/12/3 15:14,981,,8,12,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 8 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/ML83G2KF/Heidari et al. - 2021 - Effects of Climate Change on Natural-Caused Fire A.pdf,,,climate change; national forests; warming temperature; wildfire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters. For this purpose, four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters&mdash;such as daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed&mdash;and an urban parameter, population density, were considered as input data set, with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset.

The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one. Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE.

Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap. The average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe amount to 13.4 and 7.5 tCO2eq/cap, respectively, while that of Africa and the Middle East—to 1.7 tCO2eq/cap on average. Changes in consumption patterns to low-carbon alternatives therefore present a great and urgently required potential for emission reductions. In this paper, we synthesize emission mitigation potentials across the consumption domains of food, housing, transport and other consumption. Methods. We systematically screened 6990 records in the Web of Science Core Collections and Scopus. Searches were restricted to (1) reviews of lifecycle assessment studies and (2) multiregional input-output studies of household consumption, published after 2011 in English. We selected against pre-determined eligibility criteria and quantitatively synthesized findings from 53 studies in a meta-review. We identified 771 original options, which we summarized and presented in 61 consumption options with a positive mitigation potential. We used a fixed-effects model to explore the role of contextual factors (geographical, technical and socio-demographic factors) for the outcome variable (mitigation potential per capita) within consumption options. Results and discussion. We establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2eq/capita/yr. For transport, the options with the highest mitigation potential include living car-free, shifting to a battery electric vehicle, and reducing flying by a long return flight with a median reduction potential of more than 1.7 tCO2eq/cap. In the context of food, the highest carbon savings come from dietary changes, particularly an adoption of vegan diet with an average and median mitigation potential of 0.9 and 0.8 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. Shifting to renewable electricity and refurbishment and renovation are the options with the highest mitigation potential in the housing domain, with medians at 1.6 and 0.9 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. We find that the top ten consumption options together yield an average mitigation potential of 9.2 tCO2eq/cap, indicating substantial contributions towards achieving the 1.5 °C–2 °C target, particularly in high-income context.",8月-20,2021/12/3 15:15,2021/12/3 15:15,2021/12/3 15:15,93001,,9,15,,Environ.

In this study ML algorithms; Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) were used to develop MMEs for annual, monsoon and winter; precipitation (P), maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature over Pakistan using 36 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 GCMs. GCMs were ranked using Taylor Skill Score for individual seasons and variables, and then using a comprehensive Rating Metric (RM) overall rank of each GCM was determined. It was found that, HadGEM2-AO is the most skilled GCM and IPSL-CM5B-LR is the least skilled GCMs in simulating the 3 climate variables. The performance of MMEs did not improve after the inclusion of about 18 top-ranked GCMs. Thus, it was understood that the optimum performance of MMEs is achieved when about 50% of the top-ranked GCMs are used. The inter-comparison of MMEs developed with ANN, KNN, SVM and RVM revealed that KNN and RVM-based MMEs show better skills.

In this work we report on the development, implementation and application of a data-driven, statistical method for mapping SOC stocks in space and time, using Argentina as a pilot. We used quantile regression forest machine learning to predict annual SOC stock at 0–30 cm depth at 250 m resolution for Argentina between 1982 and 2017. The model was calibrated using over 5,000 SOC stock values from the 36-year time period and 35 environmental covariates. We preprocessed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dynamic covariates using a temporal low-pass filter to allow the SOC stock for a given year to depend on the NDVI of the current as well as preceding years. Predictions had modest temporal variation, with an average decrease for the entire country from 2.55 to 2.48 kg C m−2 over the 36-year period (equivalent to a decline of 211 Gg C, 3.0% of the total 0–30 cm SOC stock in Argentina). The Pampa region had a larger estimated SOC stock decrease from 4.62 to 4.34 kg C m−2 (5.9%) during the same period. For the 2001–2015 period, predicted temporal variation was seven-fold larger than that obtained using the Tier 1 approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. Prediction uncertainties turned out to be substantial, mainly due to the limited number and poor spatial and temporal distribution of the calibration data, and the limited explanatory power of the covariates. Cross-validation confirmed that SOC stock prediction accuracy was limited, with a mean error of 0.03 kg C m−2 and a root mean squared error of 2.04 kg C m−2. In spite of the large uncertainties, this work showed that machine learning methods can be used for space–time SOC mapping and may yield valuable information to land managers and policymakers, provided that SOC observation density in space and time is sufficiently large. Highlights We tested the use of machine learning for space–time mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock. Predictions for Argentina from 1982 to 2017 showed a 3% decrease of the topsoil SOC stock over time. The machine learning model predicted a greater temporal variation than the IPCC Tier 1 approach.

Yet, we don't have a clear understanding of how the content of this news coverage has changed over time, despite likely playing an important part in fostering or inhibiting public support and engagement in climate action. In this paper we use a combination of automated and manual content analysis of the most influential media sources in the U.S. -the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the Associated Press- to illustrate the prevalence of different frames in the news coverage of climate change and their dynamics over time from the start of the climate change debate in 1988. Specifically, we focus on three types of frames, based on previous research: economic costs and benefits associated with climate mitigation, appeals to conservative and free market values and principles, and uncertainties and risk surrounding climate change. We find that many of the frames found to reduce people's propensity to support and engage in climate action have been on the decline in the mainstream media, such as frames emphasizing potential economic harms of climate mitigation policy or uncertainty. At the same time, frames conducive to such engagement by the general public have been on the rise, such as those highlighting economic benefits of climate action. News content is also more likely now than in the past to use language emphasizing risk and danger, and to use the present tense. To the extent that media framing plays an important role in fostering climate action in the public, these are welcome developments.",2019,2021/12/3 15:15,2021/12/3 15:15,2021/12/3 15:15,6,,,4,,,Framing Climate Change,,,,,,,,,,,,Frontiers,,,,"/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/BC96ZNFC/Stecula i Merkley - 2019 - Framing Climate Change Economics, Ideology, and U.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, enhanced carbon storage in soils can be accounted for as greenhouse gas mitigation strategies. For such reports and policy decision making, a harmonized, representative, and reliable database of soil carbon stocks was missing so far. Thus, the German Agricultural Soil Inventory started over in 2011 assessing soil carbon contents and stocks in a nation-wide harmonized sampling system. A 8*8 km grid defined the 3100 sampling points under arable land, grassland and plantation crops. Landscape and soil type were described for each point and disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken from a 1 m3 pit. Sampling depths were 0-10, 10-30, 30-50, 50-70, and 70-100 cm. Further, from soils rich of carbon, an additional sampling of the subsoil was conducted at 100-150 and 150-200 cm. In order to evaluate the spatial heterogeneity on the field scale, eight additional soil cores were taken in a distance of 10 m around the pit. All samples were analyzed in the same lab following standardized protocols. In order to evaluate effects of arable management on soil carbon contents, farmers managing the field of a sampling point filled in a questionnaire covering the last ten years before sampling. Thus, we are able to link land use and arable management (tillage, fertilization...) information with the carbon stock measured. This enormous database of harmonized soil carbon data is a valid basis of several ongoing and future subprojects. Currently, the team is working on (i) site specific and anthropogenic drivers of arable soil's carbon stocks via machine learning, (ii) vulnerability of carbon in organic and mineral soils via density fractionation and incubation, (iii) predictability of soil carbon fractions via near infrared spectroscopy, (iv) models which predict an arable site as a sink or a source for soil carbon, (v) stratification of the sampling area (Germany) in order to enhance the predictability of soil carbon stocks, and (vi) regionalization of soil carbon data for the generation of maps via machine learning.

The rise of citizen science has also aided the spatiotemporal data collection with associated attributes. The biodiversity data from citizen observatories can be employed in machine learning algorithms for predicting suitable environmental conditions for species’ survival and their future migration behaviours. In this study, different environmental variables effective in birds’ migrations were analysed, and their habitat suitability was assessed for future understanding of their responses in different climate change scenarios. The Jacobin cuckoo (Clamator jacobinus) was selected as the subject species, since their arrival to India has been traditionally considered as a sign for the start of the Indian monsoon season. For suitability predictions in current and future scenarios, maximum entropy (Maxent) modelling was carried out with environmental variables and species occurrences observed in India and Africa. For modelling, the correlation test was performed on the environmental variables (bioclimatic, precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, precipitation, wind and elevation). The results showed that precipitation-related variables played a significant role in suitability, and through reclassified habitat suitability maps, it was observed that the suitable areas of India and Africa might decrease in future climatic scenarios (SSPs 2.6, 4.5, 7.0 and 8.5) of 2030 and 2050. In addition, the suitability and unsuitability areas were calculated (in km2) to observe the subtle changes in the ecosystem.

In this study, an ensemble of four Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Model (GCM) namely GISS-E2-H, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5, and NorESM1-M simulations was downscaled for the assessment of the spatiotemporal changes in precipitation in the data-scarce arid province (Balochistan) of Pakistan for four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The gauge-based gridded precipitation data of the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) having a spatial resolution of 0.5° was used for this purpose. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used for the development of non-local model output statistics (MOS) downscaling models for each grid by linking the GPCC precipitation with the GCM simulated precipitation across a spatial domain (latitudes 03°–45° N and longitudes 42°–92° E). Then, Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to develop the multi-model ensemble (MME) of downscaled precipitation projections. The performances of the models were assessed in terms of normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), percentage of bias (PBIAS), and modified index of agreement (md). The results indicated that the non-local SVM-based MOS models coupled with RF MME can simulate historical precipitation over the region quite well. The MME of GCMs projected changes in the annual, monsoon, and winter precipitation in the range of − 30% to 30% for different RCPs. Overall, the MME of GCMs indicated an increase in precipitation in the monsoon-dominated wetter regions in the east, while a decrease in winter precipitation dominated arid region in the west. A decrease in annual precipitation over the majority of the southeast, east, and northeastern arid regions was projected which may increase the aridity in the region.",2019/7/1,2021/12/3 15:20,2021/12/3 15:20,2021/12/3 15:20,1347-1364,,1,137,,Theor Appl Climatol,Modeling climate change impacts on precipitation in arid regions of Pakistan,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed the impact of climate change on the climatic suitability of the Persian oak in Zagros forests in southwest Iran, by simulating their conditions under four climate change scenarios in the 2030s, 2050s, 2070s, and 2080s. Additionally, we evaluated the predictive performance of different modelling algorithms by projecting the geographic distribution of Persian oak, using a block cross-validation technique. According to the results, the Persian oak shows a stronger response to temperature, particularly the maximum temperature of the warmest month, rather than precipitation variables. This indicates that temperature has a powerful control over the geographic distribution of the Persian oak. Based on a comparison of the Persian oak’s current climatic suitability and future projections, regardless of the chosen climatic scenarios, there will be an upward shift in its climatic suitability. However, an upward shift under the pessimistic scenarios was greater than the optimistic ones. The results also indicate that an ensemble of all models had a higher accuracy than single models. Despite the agreement between current climate condition predictions (mean correlation of 0.94), the projection of different algorithms for future periods is highly variable (mean correlation of 0.71).

As we see more and more people moving to urban areas an ever-increasing number settles in low-cost and more hazardous areas. However, due to the rapid growth and sheer scale of informal settlements, knowledge gaps often exist on location or quantity. In this sense, Earth Observation combined with machine learning techniques allows to generate reliable geo-information. In this study, we classify the morphologically heterogeneous entire urban area of Medellín, Colombia into urban structural types. We do this by the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme. Our specific focus is on one structural type, i.e. informal settlements. We test whether it is feasible by the LCZ concept to localize and quantify these vulnerable areas. The LCZ scheme is generic, replicable, neutral, and has become widespread in urban studies. We use urban blocks to perform a scene-based image classification into nine LCZs. We refer to multi-modal remotely-sensed data: high-resolution multispectral image data and elevation data. We apply an optimized random forest algorithm using shape metrics, as well as spectral and texture features. In general, we find the LCZ classification, measured with an overall accuracy of 82%, shows a reliable representation of urban typologies and functions across the city. Specifically, we compare the urban blocks classified as the LCZ lightweigth low-rise to the informal settlements provided by the city of Medellín. Here we reach an agreement of 86%.

To detect the presence of anurans, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are usually deployed with the aim of obtaining bio-acoustic information in a set covering numerous locations. However, the identification of the anuran species from a huge number of recordings usually involves an overwhelming task that has to be undertaken by expert and intelligent systems. Previous studies into this issue have proposed several classification techniques with a common approach: they all take into account the sequential characteristic of sounds by considering syllables or other kinds of vocal segments. In noisy sounds, as it is usually the case in recordings made in natural habitats, segmentation of the signal is no straightforward task and may cause low classification accuracy. To override this problem, a new non-sequential approach is proposed in this paper. It is based on considering very small pieces of sounds (frames) each of which is then classified without considering preceding or subsequent information. Up to nine frame-based classifiers are explored in this paper and their performances are compared to the most commonly used sequential classifier: the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Additionally, for featuring the frames, many choices have been described, although the application of the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) has probably become the most common method. In this work, an alternative methodology is suggested: the use of a set of MPEG-7 parameters, which offers a normalized solution with a much greater semantic content. The experimental results have shown that the proposed method clearly outperforms the HMM, thereby showing the non-sequential classification of anuran sounds to be feasible. From among the algorithms tested, the decision-tree classifier has shown the best performance with an overall classification success rate of 87.30%, which is an especially striking result considering that the analyzed sounds were affected by a decidedly noisy background.",2018/4/1,2021/12/3 15:20,2021/12/3 15:20,2021/12/3 15:20,248-260,,,95,,Expert Systems with Applications,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Data mining; Feature extraction; Global warming; Machine learning; Sound classification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pressure is expected to affect all driving mechanisms of soil salinization comprising alteration in soil hydrological balance, sea salt intrusion, wet/dry deposition of wind-born saline aerosols — leading to an increase in soil salinity. Soil salinity influences soil stability, bio-diversity, ecosystem functioning and soil water evaporation (1). It can be a long-term threat to agricultural activities and food security. To devise sustainable action plan investments and policy interventions, it is crucial to know when and where salt-affected soils occur. However, current estimates on spatio-temporal variability of salt-affected soils are majorly localized and future projections in response to climate change are rare. Using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, we related the available measured soil salinity values (represented by electrical conductivity of the saturated paste soil extract, ECe) to some environmental information (or predictors including outputs of Global Circulation Models, soil, crop, topographic, climatic, vegetative, and landscape properties of the sampling locations) to develop a set of data-driven predictive tools to enable the spatio-temporal predictions of soil salinity. The outputs of these tools helped us to estimate the extent and severity of the soil salinity under current and future climatic patterns at different geographical levels and identify the salinization hotspots by the end of the 21st century in response to climate change. Our analysis suggests that a soil area of 11.73 Mkm2 located in non-frigid zones has been salt-affected in at least three-fourths of the 1980 - 2018 period (2). At the country level, Brazil, Peru, Sudan, Colombia, and Namibia were estimated to have the highest rates of annual increase in the total area of soils with an ECe ≥ 4 dS m-1. Additionally, the results indicate that by the end of the 21st century, drylands of South America, southern and Western Australia, Mexico, southwest United States, and South Africa will be the salinization hotspots (compared to the 1961 - 1990 period).

Large-scale climate variables and indices - in addition to local hydrologic variables - may also provide valuable information for reservoir operations given their limitate relationship with streamflow. A new tree-based machine learning approach for updating reservoir operating rules conditioned on large-scale climate indices is proposed by selecting the most suitable reservoir decision-making pattern for each year. Multiple types of reservoir operating rules can be extracted from the historical streamflow data with different hydrological (e.g., wet and dry) conditions. Their performance can be recorded and correlated with climate indices by using a decision-tree classification model, and then the rules with the best performance conditioned on a given climate index value can be selected for reservoir operations. A case study of reservoir operations for the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile River demonstrates that the proposed tree-based reservoir operation framework can accurately select suitable decision-making rules both for normal and forecast-informed reservoir operations.

E.; Cheng, Y.; Bhoot, V.",Climate and Hydrological Controls on Coastal Harmful Algal Blooms,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFMOS11B..07N,"Microalgae play a crucial role in mediating the global carbon cycle, and underpin food webs in oceanic and coastal environments. However, when present in unusually high concentrations, coupled with toxin production, harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce detrimental effects that permeate through food chains, impacting the health of living organisms in the marine coastal environment. Adding complexity to the conditions controlling HABs, hydrological and climatic controls are inextricably linked to the water quality conditions in the watershed and at the export point. While many studies suggest nutrients drive coastal blooms, this is not always the case, leading to the problem of stressed, intractable models, and fundamentally unpredictable onset. Feedbacks and couplings through biogeochemical and biological pathways within the water column, hyporheic, and benthic zones down the watershed ultimately control the fate and delivery of metals, nutrients, and solutes important for HAB formation. Mechanistic representation and understanding of these complex, non-linear drivers is poorly understood, and in this work we present novel machine learning and numerical modeling approaches to address this challenge. To test our hypothesis that river conditions and subsequent exports can exert control over formation of HABs at the freshwater-marine interface, we developed a comprehensive numerical modeling framework that includes these processes: algal ecology, watershed hydrology, reactive transport of chemical species, coastal lagoon conditions. Specifically, movement of the water and transport of nutrients (i.e. iron, nitrogen) were simulated within a Southern Californian watershed using watershed and reactive transport models. Results demonstrate the relative controls of climate, watershed dynamics and coastal boundary conditions on lagoon water quality and algal bloom dynamics across seasons.",2019/12/1,2021/12/3 15:21,2021/12/3 15:21,2021/12/3 15:21,OS11B-07,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2019AGUFMOS11B..07N,,,,,0414 Biogeochemical cycles; 0439 Ecosystems; 4817 Food webs; 4855 Phytoplankton; and dynamics; and modeling; BIOGEOSCIENCES; OCEANOGRAPHY: BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL; processes; structure; structure and dynamics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our detection approach invokes statistical learning and climate model simulations to encapsulate the relationship between spatial patterns of daily temperature and humidity, and key climate change metrics such as annual global mean temperature or Earth’s energy imbalance. Observations are projected onto this relationship to detect climate change. The fingerprint of climate change is detected from any single day in the observed global record since early 2012, and since 1999 on the basis of a year of data. Detection is robust even when ignoring the long-term global warming trend.

Information monitoring technology is used to reduce information uncertainty about the regularity of air temperature changes during managing work in hard-to-reach places [1]. The task was to create a method for modelling one of the climatic indicators, air temperature, in the given territories in the information monitoring technology structure. Climate models are the main tools for studying the response of the ecological system to external and internal influences. The problem of reducing information uncertainty in making managerial decisions is eliminated by predicting the consequences of using planned control actions using climate modelling methods in information monitoring technology. The information technology of climate monitoring combines satellite observation methods and observations on climate stations, taking into account the spatial and temporal characteristics, to form an array of input data. It was made with the methods for synthesizing models of monitoring information systems [1] and methods of forming multilevel model structures of the monitoring information systems [1] for converting observation results into knowledge, and with the rules for interpreting obtained results for calculating the temperature value in the uncontrolled territories. Objective of the work is to solve the problem of identifying the functional dependence of the air temperature in a given uncontrolled territory on the results of observations of the climate characteristics by meteorological stations in the information technology of climate monitoring structure. Method. The methodology for creating information technologies for monitoring has been improved to expand its capabilities to perform new tasks of forecasting temperature using data from thermal imaging satellites and weather stations by using a new method of climate modelling. A systematic approach to the process of climate modelling and the group method of data handling were used for solving problems of functional dependence identification, methods of mathematical statistics for evaluating models. Results. The deviation of the calculated temperature values with the synthesized monitoring information systems models from the actual values obtained from the results of observations by artificial earth satellites does not, on average, exceed 2.5°С. Temperature traces obtained from satellite images and weather stations at similar points show similar dynamics. Conclusions. The problem of the functional dependence identification of air temperature in uncontrolled territories on the results of observations at meteorological stations is solved. The obtained results were used in the process of creating a new method of climate modelling within information technology of climate monitoring. Experimental confirmation of the hypothesis about the possibility of using satellite images in regional models of temperature prediction has been obtained. The effectiveness of the application of the methodology for the creation of monitoring information technologies during the implementation of the tasks of reducing uncertainty for management decisions during works in non-controlled territories has been proven.",2021/7/8,2021/12/3 15:22,2021/12/3 15:22,2021/12/3 15:22,154-163,,2,,,,,,,,,,,en,"Copyright (c) 2021 M.

Overall, 36 simulation-optimization scenarios for dry and wet years under baseline and climate change conditions are evaluated by considering three initial water levels for the reservoir (minimum, average, and normal) and three thresholds for assessing the hybrid algorithm. The TDS released from the reservoir in wet years would be acceptable for agricultural use; in dry years, on average, the TDS would not be acceptable for 24 days per year under climate change. The reservoir in winter undergoes complete mixing; it becomes stratified in spring and summer, and it is close to complete mixing in the autumn.

Practical drought hazard mapping remains challenging due to possible exclusion of the most pertinent drought drivers, and to the use of inadequate predictive models that cannot describe drought adequately. This research aims to develop new approaches to map agricultural drought hazard with state-of-the-art machine learning models, including classification and regression trees (CART), boosted regression trees (BRT), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA) and support vector machines (SVM). Hydro-environmental datasets were used to calculate the relative departure of soil moisture (RDSM) for eight severe droughts for drought-prone southeast Queensland, Australia, over the period 1994–2013. RDSM was then used to generate an agricultural drought inventory map. Eight hydro-environmental factors were used as potential predictors of drought. The goodness-of-fit and predictive performance of all models were evaluated using different threshold-dependent and threshold-independent methods, including the true skill statistic (TSS), Efficiency (E), F-score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The RF model (AUC-ROC = 97.7%, TSS = 0.873, E = 0.929, F-score = 0.898) yielded the highest accuracy, while the FDA model (with AUC-ROC = 73.9%, TSS = 0.424, E = 0.719, F-score = 0.512) showed the worst performance. The plant available water holding capacity (PAWC), mean annual precipitation, and clay content were the most important variables to be used for predicting the agricultural drought. About 21.2% of the area is in high or very high drought risk classes, and therefore, warrant drought and environmental protection policies. Importantly, the models do not require data on the precipitation anomaly for any given drought year; the spatial patterns in AGH were consistent for all drought events, despite very different spatial patterns in precipitation anomaly among events. Such machine-learning approaches are able to construct an overall risk map, thus assisting in the adoption of a robust drought contingency planning measure not only for this area, but also, in other regions where drought presents a pressing challenge, including its influence on key practical dimensions of social, environmental and economic sustainability.",2020/1/10,2021/12/3 15:24,2021/12/3 15:24,2021/12/3 15:24,134230,,,699,,Science of The Total Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,"Australia; Drought; GIS; Spatial analysis, artificial intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Birch trees (Betula spp.) are important sources of aeroallergens in Central and Northern Europe. Birches are vulnerable to climate change as these trees are sensitive to increased temperatures and summer droughts. This study aims to examine the effect of climate change on airborne birch pollen concentrations in Central Europe using Bavaria in Southern Germany as a case study. Pollen data from 28 monitoring stations in Bavaria were used in this study, with time series of up 30 years long. An integrative approach was used to model airborne birch pollen concentrations taking into account drivers influencing birch tree abundance and birch pollen production and projections made according to different climate change and socioeconomic scenarios. Birch tree abundance is projected to decrease in parts of Bavaria at different rates, depending on the climate scenario, particularly in current centres of the species distribution. Climate change is expected to result in initial increases in pollen load but, due to the reduction in birch trees, the amount of airborne birch pollen will decrease at lower altitudes. Conversely, higher altitude areas will experience expansions in birch tree distribution and subsequent increases in airborne birch pollen in the future. Even considering restrictions for migration rates, increases in pollen load are likely in Southwestern areas, where positive trends have already been detected during the last three decades. Integrating models for the distribution and abundance of pollen sources and the drivers that control birch pollen production allowed us to model airborne birch pollen concentrations in the future.

It is expected to further expand the risk of plant invasion through ecosystem disturbance. Particularly, island ecosystems are under pressure, and climate change may threaten forest-dependent species. However, scientific and societal unknowns make it difficult to predict how climate change and biological invasions will affect species interactions and ecosystem processes. The purpose of this study was to identify possible limitations when making species distribution model projections based on predicted climate change. We aimed to know if climatic variables alone were good predictors of habitat suitability, ensuring reliable projections. In particular, we compared the performance of generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and a selection of machine learning techniques (BIOMOD 2) when modelling the distribution of forest species in the Azores, according to the climatic changes predicted to 2100. Some limitations seem to exist when modelling the effect of climate change on species distributions, since the best models also included topographic variables, making modelling based on climate alone less reliable, with model fit varying among modelling approaches, and random forest often providing the best results. Our results emphasize the adoption of a careful study design and algorithm selection process.

With the rapidly growing amount of observations and computing capacity, however, the argument of adequacy based on understanding is now often replaced by measures of 'model fit'. While such quantitative methods are powerful, and recent developments in machine learning offer promising tools to evaluate models and detect the anthropogenic signal, such 'beauty contests' may keep us from asking the most important question: what is this model designed for, useful for, and what is the risk of being misled by the wealth of details it provides?

Scalability of massively parallel codes is seen as the key to pushing towards 1km global models. Here we address a complementary approach. Predominately weather and climate models calculate using 64-bit arithmetic, a historic norm from machines which gave performance comparable to 32-bit arithmetic. Recently machine learning has moved in the direction of short precisions, 16-bits (half precision) and below, with the necessary linear algebra performed on accelerator hardware. The question is whether the weather and climate community can take advantage of these hardware developments. The inherent inaccuracies in current models, from large grid spacing to uncertain physical parameterisation schemes, suggest that lower than 64-bit precisions are feasible, but is half-precision achievable? Using software emulation we investigate kernels of ECMWF's OpenIFS model, focusing on the significand bits. On both weather and climate timescales large precision reductions are possible, even as resolution is increased towards operational levels. While uniform half-precision appears challenging we are able to reduce the majority of the investigated fields and calculations to this threshold.

This study presents a novel machine learning (ML)-based downscaling algorithm that produces a high spatial resolution groundwater level anomaly (GWLA) from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data by utilizing the relationship between Terrestrial Water Storage Anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE and other land surface and hydro-climatic variables (e.g., vegetation coverage, land surface temperature, precipitation, streamflow, and in-situ groundwater level data). The predicted downscaled GWLA data were tested using monthly in-situ groundwater level observations. Of the 32 groundwater monitoring wells available in the study site, 21 wells were used to develop the ML-based downscaling model, while the remaining 11 wells were used to assess the performance of the ML-based downscaling model. The test results showed that the model satisfactorily reproduces the spatial and temporal variation of the GWLA in the area, with acceptable correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency values of ~0.76 and ~0.45, respectively. GRACE TWSA was the most influential predictor variable in the models, followed by stream discharge and soil moisture storage.

A filter known as Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU) was used to rank the GCMs considering their ability to simulate monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperature for the historical period (1961–2005). The highest rank GCMs that represents the widest range of projection was then selected for the projection of temperature through statistical downscaling. A linear bias correction approach was used for the downscaling of temperature, a random forest regression was used to generate multi-model ensemble (MME) mean of projections and a quantile regression (QR) was used to assess the trends in projections at 95% level of confidence. Four GCMs namely, HadGEM2-AO, HadGEM2-ES, MIROC5 and MIROC-ESM were found most suitable for projection of temperature of Iraq. Ensemble mean of the selected GCMs revealed increases in minimum temperatures in the range of 1.5–2.4 °C, 1.6–3.6 °C, 1.2–4.2 °C, and 1.3–6.2 °C and maximum temperatures in the range of 1.7–2.9 °C, 1.8–4.4 °C, 1.5–4.9 °C, and 1.7–6.8 °C under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively during 2070–2099. Higher increases in temperatures were projected in the north and northeast of Iraq where the average temperature is usually low, which indicates that spatial distribution of temperature would be more homogeneous in future compared to base years.

This paper sets out the options for modelling suspended sediment concentrations to determine them in periods when measurements were not performed. The Danube River profile in Bratislava was selected as the case study. Regression using least absolute selection and shrinkage operator, support vector regression and deep learning neural network are compared in the paper to solve this task using various data sources. The results obtained show a significant increase in the precision of modelling suspended sediment concentrations over the standard method, which is a rating curve. Several variables were used to establish the suspended sediment concentration, because the same data as in this study may not be available everywhere. In particular, the use of climatic (precipitation and temperature) and hydrological inputs (flows) is assessed in order to promote the more general benefit of work. In the article, the authors propose an original method of modification of input climate data, which significantly increases the accuracy of modelling. The authors demonstrate that when using proposed methodology, the use of climate data, which are usually better available than hydrological data, resulted in a comparable degree of precision to standard modelling based on river flow data.",2020/11/10,2021/12/3 15:25,2021/12/3 15:25,2021/12/3 15:25,192-210,,1,23,,Journal of Hydroinformatics,,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/59C4QLIW/Cisty et al. - 2020 - Suspended sediment modelling with hydrological and.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, several water management issues have been addressed by means of models derived from Artificial Intelligence research. When using machine learning based models, the main challenging aspects are represented by the choice of the best possible algorithm, the choice of adequately representative variables and the availability of appropriate data sets. Machine learning algorithms may be a powerful tool for the prediction of actual evapotranspiration, when a time series of few years is available. Starting from the measurements of a sufficient number of climatic parameters it is possible to obtain forecasting models characterized by very high accuracy and precision. Three different evapotranspiration models have been compared in this study. The models differ in the input variables. Four variants of each model were applied, varying the machine learning algorithm: M5P Regression Tree, Bagging, Random Forest and Support Vector Regression. The data refers to an experimental site in Central Florida, characterized by humid subtropical climate. The best outcomes have been provided by Model 1, whose input variables were net solar radiation, sensible-heat flux, moisture content of the soil, wind speed, mean relative humidity and mean temperature. Model 3, built from data only of mean temperature, mean relative humidity and net solar radiation, has provided still satisfactory results.

In recent years, the risk of extreme weather events has increased due to climate change. However, existing assessment models are not essentially used to explore short-term drastic changes in the environment, such as extreme heat or cold. Therefore, we proposed a climate-food risk assessment system that could detect drastic changes, such as extreme weather events and price fluctuations, in a timely and thorough manner. On the one hand, spikes were detected in the climate system. On the other hand, change points were detected in the food system. Finally, an innovative integrated analysis algorithm is carried out to obtain the ranking of highly impacted foods. Across all food supply chains, we found that sugar, bread and grains, and wine in grapes are most closely related to extreme weather events. This discovery needs to be treated with caution. To initiate a feasible control strategy for climate risk, a concrete policy implication was discussed in detail.

Owing to the rapid development of machine learning techniques, a series of powerful tools have been proposed over the past two decades, allowing the scientific community to obtain new insights into the patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) on different spatial scales ranging from ecosystem to global. The primary focus of this study was to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of both extreme learning machine (ELM) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate the daily ET with flux tower observations in four main types of ecosystems. A comparative research was undertaken to evaluate the potential of the models compared with the conventional artificial neural network and support vector machine models. All the developed models were evaluated according to the following performance indices: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error and mean absolute error. The results showed that all the applied models had high performance for modeling daily ET (e.g., R2 = 0.9398–0.9593 and NSE = 0.8877–0.9147 in forest ecosystem). Among the applied ELM models, the three hybrid ELM methods outperformed the original ELM method in most cases at the four sites and the computational time required for learning these ELM models has been considerably reduced. The subtractive clustering and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithms for ANFIS generally performed better than the grid partitioning algorithm. It was concluded that the advanced ELM and ANFIS models can be recommended as important complements to traditional methods due to their robustness and flexibility. Moreover, significant difference regarding the modeling performance existed among the four major ecosystems types. The models generally achieved the best performance in forest ecosystem, while provided the worst in cropland ecosystem.",2018/5/1,2021/12/3 15:25,2021/12/3 15:25,2021/12/3 15:25,95-106,,,148,,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Eddy covariance; Evapotranspiration; Extreme learning machine; Machine learning; Terrestrial ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data were preprocessed and used to build RVM models. To evaluate the proposed RVM, its performance was compared to that of a SVM. The results were validated using ANOVA. A significant correlation between the two datasets was found. The relevance vectors for the RVM were significantly less than the support vectors for the SVM, and the TCC for the RVM was significantly better than the TCC for the SVM. The prediction accuracy of both the RVM and the SVM were found to be statistically equal. The RVM model was able to project the impact of GASAT on WTI crude oil prices from 2014 to 2023.

Previous regional studies have suggested that the predictable seasonal pattern of a climatic time series, or seasonality, might aid in the prediction of average fire activity, but it is not known whether these findings are applicable globally. Here, we investigate how seasonality can be used to explain variations in fire activity on a global scale. Location Global, 60° S–60° N. Time period Data averaged over the period 1999–2015. Methods We describe a method to partition a periodic seasonal cycle into two seasons and define conceptually simple temporal metrics that describe spatial variability in seasonality. We explore the usefulness of these metrics in explaining global fire activity using the average monthly time series of precipitation and temperature and a flexible machine learning procedure (random forests). Results A simple model that uses only precipitation and temperature amplitude and synchrony between wet and warm seasons correctly predicts 66% of the variability in global fire activity, substantially more than a model with mean annual temperature and precipitation. A more complex model that includes all nine metrics predicts 87% of variability in global fire activity. Main conclusions This study shows that seasonality of temperature and precipitation can be used to predict multi-year average fire activity in a globally relevant way. The mechanisms highlighted in our work could be used to improve global fire models and enhance their ability to represent the spatial patterns of fire activity.

Global climate change and anthropogenic impacts on surface water resources have led to increased competing claims on groundwater resources to meet an exponential water demand for environmental needs, agricultural and developmental needs. This has led to the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources, resulting in groundwater table declines, threatening the sustainability of TGDV. It is on this premise that the review aims to provide a detailed overview on the progress in remote sensing of TGDV. More specifically, the paper provides a background on TGDV and threats, and then further explores recent knowledge on vegetation response to groundwater variability and climate change impacts on TGDV. This review also focuses on recent progress in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) based techniques for mapping and monitoring of TGDV and explores the available satellite products and delineation techniques. Finally, the challenges of remote sensing and future research direction are explored. To date, research on TGDV has gained considerable interest with the year 2020 resulting in the most scientific journal publications. Of significant importance is an increase in studies integrating field measurements, model-based techniques with remotely sensed estimates. Despite this progress, only 0.06% of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) research has utilized remote sensing techniques in the past 20 years, with the top three publishing countries namely, Australia, USA, and China. The literature reveals that TDGV are highly heterogenous, complex ecosystems with unique responses to varying groundwater levels. The vegetation responses differ with the landscape, vegetation type, and seasonality at specific groundwater table thresholds. Despite significant progress in TGDV scientific research, further remote sensing studies are required to understand the annual and inter-annual vegetation response to groundwater variability at local scales. Further, climate impacts are difficult to discriminate from other influences such as disturbances, management, and anthropogenic activities. Moreover, new generation remote sensing products integrated with machine learning techniques have the potential to improve TGDV delineation. Despite these challenges, the development of cloud computing technologies such as google earth engine (GEE) and artificial intelligence (AI) provide advanced computer-processing capabilities for long-term monitoring and integration of multi-source datasets required to capture the effects of climate and groundwater variability on TGDV.",2021/6/30,2021/12/3 15:25,2021/12/3 15:25,2021/12/3 15:25,25-1月,,0,0,,,Impacts of groundwater and climate variability on terrestrial groundwater dependent ecosystems,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2021.1948108,,,,,Arid environments; cloud computing; groundwater resources; satellite data; vegetation responses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its perception among citizens, however, is highly controversial. For example, in August 2018, the negative effects of climate change were very prominent in the state of Bavaria, when farmers lost large amounts of feed crop due to a drought in the same year. While governments can initiate policies in response to this, implementing these policies in a democracy requires the approval of the public, which is mainly composed of non-experts. In order to mobilize citizens for their own benefit, thus promote citizen science, the Bavarian Climate Research Network (BAYKLIF) was launched. One of the objectives deals with the creation of a portal and a number of mobile services for citizens, domain specialists and decision makers. This paper is dedicated to a project within this network, which is relevant to cartography. It aims to create a Climate Event Portal accessible by normal citizens who may also contribute with their own data to the portal or validate existing climate events based on their knowledge and supported by visualization tools. The anticipated portal consists of five core concepts. First, the OpenEventCollector, which will search for climate events by categories and collect event data in an interactive and intuitive way. Second, an OpenEventCrawler, that should automatically search open digital archives and social media, thus keep generating data about climate events. Third, an OpenEventEditor, to visualize the data for the user, allow them to interact with the data, and contribute their own (Fig. 1). This, however, must all be possible within the technical limitations of smartphones or web-applications. Fourth, an OpenEventDetector, which should automatically detect climate events from datasets, via machine learning. Fifth, an OpenEventAnalysor that explains the context of climate events, the visualizations and the process of generating this data. The purpose of this Climate Event Portal is to involve the user, thus ensuring that all data permits the re-use is necessary. Its development reveals three interrelated challenges: (1) examining user-generated data for relevance and legal compliance, (2) improving representative user feedback, which requires the participation of diverse user groups and (3) sustaining users' interest and attention, which requires innovative incentives for users' contributions (e.g. gamification-oriented visualization, visual storytelling etc.). This work will contribute to the knowledge on how to adapt presentations based on citizens' interaction, as well as create an event portal, where citizen-contributed data and expert-generated data are coalesced.

The advent of the 4th industrial revolution has seen the increased application of digitalization in several fields and at different levels. High-tech digital devices, platforms and environments are increasingly being deployed to enhance productivity, efficiency and sustainability, and improve overall well-being of urban dwellers. Digitalization is projected to further impact cities in future, transform jobs and trigger life-style changes with far-reaching impacts that will ultimately affect cities’ resilience and adaptation capacities. While a growing body of research has highlighted the significance of digitalization to climate change mitigation such as reducing GHG and CO2 emissions, comprehensive evaluations of the potentials of digitalization as an enabler of climate change adaptation remain scarce. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the current trend in digital revolution in relation to climate change adaptation and examines the likely challenges of digitalization. A desk research method was adopted, focusing on core digitalization concepts driving the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0). Nine case studies in cities across various continents were selected to assess the potentials of digitalization in addressing climatic hazards and to highlight benefits from implementing digitalization, while considering the social-ecological-technological challenges and tensions around IR 4.0. Our findings reveal the capabilities of digitalization in supporting more effective early warning and emergency response systems, enhancing food and water security, improving power infrastructure performance, enabling citizen engagement and participatory adaptation measures and minimizing the impacts of climatic hazards.

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Boosted Regression Tress (BRT) algorithm of machine learning were used to predict the current and future distribution. The occurrence records of C. peltata was obtained from Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). There were 2691 occurrence records in GBIF database. The global climatic variables with the resolution 2.5 km were used as predictors of model. VIF was used to select the multicollinearity among those variables using threshold of 0.7.

We fit models on data from 2002 through 2011, used Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) to select the best-fitting model, and used 2012 as out-of-sample data for prediction, and repeated this process for each successive year, ending with fitting models on 2002–2017 data and using 2018 for out-of-sample prediction. We found that warm temperatures and a dry year preceded by a wet year were the strongest predictors of cases of WNV. Our models did significantly better than random chance and better than an annual persistence naïve model at predicting which counties would have cases. Exploring different scenarios, the model predicted that without drought, there would have been 26% fewer cases of WNV in Nebraska through 2018; without warm temperatures, 29% fewer; and with neither drought nor warmth, 45% fewer.

The ambient temperature of this region is extremely low, with a minimum average temperature of 2–18 °C. Major settlements in this region are located at an altitude of more than 1000 m above sea level. Therefore, according to The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), India, there is excessive thermal and electrical energy consumption in these regions pertaining to space heating. Moreover, the current energy sources utilized are not clean sources and hence contribute towards CO2 emissions. A building-integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) system is modelled to provide the necessary thermal energy alongside electricity for space heating intended for the climatic conditions of Srinagar. The study utilized an application-centric approach in modelling and analyzing the BIPVT system and, hence quantifying the annual outputs for Srinagar, India. Furthermore, the developed mathematical model is used for training an artificial neural network to predict the annual thermal and exergy outputs of the system based on six different model parameters. Three designs, one operational and two application-based parameters are considered as inputs to the network. Moreover, a multi-criteria decision-making method is employed to determine the best set of BIPVT parameters giving optimum annual thermal and exergy outputs along with electrical, thermal and exergy efficiencies of the modelled system. The modelled neural network performed reasonably well against the unseen test dataset in predicting the BIPVT yield with an R2 value >0.97. An optimum annual thermal and exergy gains of 2,25,459 kWh and 67,132.38 kWh, respectively, are quantified for the best set of BIPVT parameters. The system’s optimum average electrical (power conversion), thermal and exergy efficiencies are observed to be 14.87, 56.28, and 17.59%, respectively.",2021/9/15,2021/12/3 15:27,2021/12/3 15:27,2021/12/3 15:27,114488,,,244,,Energy Conversion and Management,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,ANN; BIPVT; Exergy; Machine learning; TOPSIS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wildfires are among one of the main drivers leading to losses in forested areas. The increasing availability of free remotely sensed data has enabled the precise locations of wildfires to be reliably monitored. A wildfire data inventory was created by integrating global positioning system (GPS) polygons with data collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product between 2012 and 2017 for Amol County, northern Iran. The GPS polygon dataset from the state wildlife organization was gathered through extensive field surveys. The integrated inventory dataset, along with sixteen conditioning factors (topographic, meteorological, vegetation, anthropological, and hydrological factors), was used to evaluate the potential of different machine learning (ML) approaches for the spatial prediction of wildfire susceptibility. The applied ML approaches included an artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF). All ML approaches were trained using 75% of the wildfire inventory dataset and tested using the remaining 25% of the dataset in the four-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure. The CV method is used for dealing with the randomness effects of the training and testing dataset selection on the performance of applied ML approaches. To validate the resulting wildfire susceptibility maps based on three different ML approaches and four different folds of inventory datasets, the true positive and false positive rates were calculated. In the following, the accuracy of each of the twelve resulting maps was assessed through the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve.

A total of 132 spectral and texture variables were extracted from Sentinel-2 imagery (February 7, 2017) to predict AGB of the National Park using RF algorithm. It was found that a combination of 132 spectral and texture variables could predict AGB with an R2 value of 0.94, RMSE of 34.5 Mgha−1 and %RMSE of 18.3%. RF regression algorithm was further used to reduce the number of variables in such a way that a minimum number of selected variables can be able to estimate AGB at a satisfactory level.

Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and nonnegativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large-scale environment.",2018,2021/10/6 16:53,2021/10/6 16:53,2021/10/6 16:53,2548-2563,,10,10,,,Using Machine Learning to Parameterize Moist Convection,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018MS001351,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/HC5TCDIM/O'Gorman i Dwyer - 2018 - Using Machine Learning to Parameterize Moist Conve.pdf,,,climate change; machine learning; extreme events; moist convection; parameterization; subgrid modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine-learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD) level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark) and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network) to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R2 ˜ 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction.",2019/8/15,2021/10/6 16:55,2021/10/6 16:55,2021/10/6 16:55,144-159,,,274,,Agricultural and Forest Meteorology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Machine learning; Crop yield prediction; Enhanced vegetation index; Solar-induced fluorescence; Wheat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this is challenging because the performance of a forecasting algorithm may be affected by various factors, such as data quality, geographic diversity, forecast horizon, customer segmentation and the forecast origin. Furthermore, an approach that performs well in one region may fail in other regions, and similarly, a model that forecasts accurately in one horizon may fail to produce an accurate prediction for other horizons. To overcome the above challenges such as rough data quality, different forecasting horizons, different kinds of loads and forecasting for different regions, this study proposes four machine learning/supervised learning models. These models are applied to improve the generalization of the network and reduce forecasting. These models are intended to simplify or demystify terms, complex concepts and data granularity used in energy forecasting. Two different data sites and four forecasting horizons are used to validate the proposed models. The coefficient of variation and mean absolute percentage error are 50% higher as compared with the existing model. The proposed supervised learning models ensure a generalization ability, robustness and high accuracy for building and utilities energy consumption forecasting.

The identification of hotspots of the yield gap, where the potential for improvement is the greatest, is a necessary step towards this goal. While crop growth models are well suited to quantify potential yields, they lack the ability to provide accurate large-scale estimates of actual yields, owing to the sheer quantity of data they require for parameterisation. In this context, we sought to provide accurate estimates of actual wheat yields across the Australian wheat belt based on machine-learning regression methods, climate records and satellite image time series. Out of nine base learners and two ensembles, support vector regression with radial basis function emerged as the single best learner (root mean square error of 0.55 t ha−1 and R2 of 0.77 at the pixel level). At national scale, this model explained 73% of the yield variability observed across statistical units. Benchmark approaches based on peak Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and on a harvest index were largely outperformed by the machine-learning regression models (R2 < 0.46). Climate variables such as maximum temperatures and accumulated rainfall provided additional information to the 16-day NDVI time series as they significantly improved yield predictions. Variables observed up to and around the flowering period had a particularly high predictive power with additional information gained from data during grain filling. We further showed that, while all models were sensitive to a reduction of the training set size, a large majority had not reached saturation with a data set of 125 fields (2000 pixels). This indicates that additional training data are likely to further improve the skill of the models. We estimated that observations from 75 fields (1200 pixels) are required for the best single model to reach an R2 of 0.7. We contend that machine-learning regression methods applied to climate and satellite image time series can achieve reliable crop yield monitoring across years at both the pixel and the country scale. The resulting yield estimates meet the accuracy requirements for mapping the yield gap and identifying yield gap hotspots which could be targeted for further work by agricultural researchers and advisers.",2020/2/1,2021/10/6 16:56,2021/10/6 16:56,2021/10/6 16:56,124-135,,,160,,ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Machine learning; Actual yield; Agriculture; National scale; Regression; Remote sensing; Yield Gap,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Process-based crop models are useful tools to evaluate climate change impacts on crop productivity but are usually limited in modelling the effects of ECEs due to over-simplification or vague description of certain process and uncertainties in parameterization. In this study, we firstly developed a hybrid model by incorporating the APSIM model outputs and growth stage-specific ECEs indicators (i.e. frost, drought and heat stress) into the Random Forest (RF) model, with the multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a benchmark. The results showed that the APSIM + RF hybrid model could explain 81% of the observed yield variations in the New South Wales wheat belt of south-eastern Australia, which had a 33% improvement in modelling accuracy compared to the APSIM model alone and 19% improvement compared to the APSIM + MLR hybrid model. Drought events during the grain-filling and vegetative stages and heat events immediately prior to anthesis were identified as the three most serious ECEs causing yield losses. We then compared the APSIM + RF hybrid model with the APSIM model to estimate the effects of future climate change on wheat yield. It was interesting to find that future yield projected from single APSIM model might have a 1–10% overestimation compared to the APSIM + RF hybrid model. The APSIM + RF hybrid model indicated that we were underestimating the effects of climate change and future yield might be lower than predicted using single APSIM informed modelling due to lack of adequately accounting for ECEs-induced yield losses. Increasing heat events around anthesis and grain-filling periods were identified to be major factors causing yield losses in the future.

This random forest is then coupled to FV3GFS, adding corrective tendencies of temperature, specific humidity and horizontal winds at each timestep. The coupled model shows no signs of instability in year-long simulations and has significant reductions in short-term forecast error for 500 hPa height, surface pressure and near-surface temperature.

In this study, passive, active, and combined passive/active solutions in PCMs systems have been comprehensively reviewed, when being applied in heating, cooling and electrical systems, together with a dialectical analysis on advantages and disadvantages. In addition to novel system designs, interdisciplinary applications of machine learning have been reviewed and formulated, from perspectives of reliable structures, smart operational controls, and stochastic uncertainty-based performance prediction. Furthermore, a generic methodology with a systematic and hierarchical procedure has been proposed, with the implementation of machine-learning based technique for optimisations during both design and operation periods. The mechanisms of machine learning techniques were characterised as the simplifications of modelling and optimization processes, through the errors-driven update, the support vector regression and the backpropagation neural network. Several technical challenges were identified, such as the heat transfer enhancement, the novel structural configurations and the flexible switch on operating modes. Finally, identified challenges on machine learning include the development of advanced learning algorithms for efficient performance predictions, optimal structural configurations on neural networks, the trade-off between computational complexity and reliable optimal solutions, and so on.

However, fully interactive atmospheric chemistry schemes needed for calculating changes in ozone are computationally expensive. Climate modelers therefore often use climatological ozone fields, which are typically neither consistent with the actual climate state simulated by each model nor with the specific climate change scenario. This limitation applies in particular to standard modeling experiments such as preindustrial control or abrupt 4xCO2 climate sensitivity simulations. Here we suggest a novel method using a simple linear machine learning regression algorithm to predict ozone distributions for preindustrial and abrupt 4xCO2 simulations. Using the atmospheric temperature field as the only input, the regression reliably predicts three-dimensional ozone distributions at monthly to daily time intervals. In particular, the representation of stratospheric ozone variability is much improved compared with a fixed climatology, which is important for interactions with dynamical phenomena such as the polar vortices and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. Our method requires training data covering only a fraction of the usual length of simulations and thus promises to be an important stepping stone towards a range of new computationally efficient methods to consider ozone changes in long climate simulations.

We aimed to use machine learning methods to systematically synthesise an evidence base on climate change and human health. Methods We used supervised machine learning and other natural language processing methods (topic modelling and geoparsing) to systematically identify and map the scientific literature on climate change and health published between Jan 1, 2013, and April 9, 2020. Only literature indexed in English were included. We searched Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, and PubMed using title, abstract, and keywords only. We searched for papers including both a health component and an explicit mention of either climate change, climate variability, or climate change-relevant weather phenomena. We classified relevant publications according to the fields of climate research, climate drivers, health impact, date, and geography. We used supervised and unsupervised machine learning to identify and classify relevant articles in the field of climate and health, with outputs including evidence heat maps, geographical maps, and narrative synthesis of trends in climate health-related publications. We included empirical literature of any study design that reported on health pathways associated with climate impacts, mitigation, or adaptation. Findings We predict that there are 15 963 studies in the field of climate and health published between 2013 and 2019. Climate health literature is dominated by impact studies, with mitigation and adaptation responses and their co-benefits and co-risks remaining niche topics. Air quality and heat stress are the most frequently studied exposures, with all-cause mortality and infectious disease incidence being the most frequently studied health outcomes. Seasonality, extreme weather events, heat, and weather variability are the most frequently studied climate-related hazards. We found major gaps in evidence on climate health research for mental health, undernutrition, and maternal and child health. Geographically, the evidence base is dominated by studies from high-income countries and China, with scant evidence from low-income counties, which often suffer most from the health consequences of climate change. Interpretation Our findings show the importance and feasibility of using automated machine learning to comprehensively map the science on climate change and human health in the age of big literature. These can provide key inputs into global climate and health assessments. The scant evidence on climate change response options is concerning and could significantly hamper the design of evidence-based pathways to reduce the effects on health of climate change. In the post-2015 Paris Agreement era of climate solutions, we believe much more attention should be given to climate adaptation and mitigation options and their effects on human health.

Although climate data from various GCMs have been increasingly used in climate change impact studies, GCMs configurations and module characteristics vary from one to another. Therefore, it is crucial to assess different GCMs to confirm the extent to which they can reproduce the observed temperature and rainfall. Rather than assessing the interdependence of each GCM, the purpose of this study is to compare the capacity of four different multi-model ensemble (MME) methods (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], Bayesian model averaging [BMA] and the arithmetic ensemble mean [EM]) in reproducing observed monthly rainfall and temperature. Of these four methods, the RF and SVM demonstrated a significant improvement over EM and BMA in terms of performance criteria. The relative importance of each GCM based on the RF ensemble in reproducing rainfall and temperature could also be ranked. We compared the GCMs importance and Taylor skill score and found that their correlation was 0.95 for temperature and 0.54 for rainfall. Our results also demonstrated that the number of GCMs ensemble simulations could be reduced from 33 to 25 in RF model while maintaining predictive error less than 2%. Having such a representative subset of simulations could reduce computational costs for climate impact modelling and maintain the quality of ensemble at the same time.

Spatially and temporally explicit estimates of life-cycle environmental impacts are therefore needed for suggesting location and time relevant environmental mitigations strategies. Emission factors and process-based mechanism models are popular approaches used to estimate life-cycle environmental impacts. However, emission factors are often incapable of describing spatial and temporal heterogeneity of agricultural emissions, whereas process-based mechanistic models, capable of capturing the heterogeneity, tend to be very complicated and time-consuming. Efficient prediction of life-cycle environmental impacts from agricultural production is lacking. This study develops a rapid predictive model to quantify life-cycle global warming (GW) and eutrophication (EU) impacts of corn production using a novel machine learning approach. We used the boosted regression tree (BRT) model to estimate future life-cycle environmental impacts of corn production in U.S. Midwest counties under four emissions scenarios for years 2022–2100. Results from BRT models indicate that the cross-validation (R2) for predicting life cycle GW and EU impacts ranged from 0.78 to 0.82, respectively. Furthermore, results show that future life-cycle GW and EU impacts of corn production will increase in magnitude under all four emissions scenarios, with the highest environmental impacts shown under the high-emissions scenario. Moreover, this study found that changes in precipitation and temperature played a significant role in influencing the spatial heterogeneity in all life-cycle impacts across Midwest counties.

The space of free parameters is sampled running the single-column model from which metrics are estimated in the full parameter space using emulators. The parameter space is then reduced by retaining only the values for which the emulated metrics match large eddy simulations within a given tolerance to error. The approach is applied to the 6A version of the LMDZ model which results from a long investment in the development of physics parameterizations and by-hand tuning. The boundary layer is revisited by increasing the vertical resolution and varying parameters that were kept fixed so far, which improves the representation of clouds at process scale. The approach allows us to automatically reach a tuning of this modified configuration as good as that of the 6A version. We show how this approach helps accelerate the introduction of new parameterizations.

In particular, accurate G models are required to monitor and forecast local electricity demand. However, G forecasting is a multivariate problem, and thus models must employ robust pattern recognition algorithms that can detect subtle variations in G due to causal factors, such as climate variables. Therefore, this study developed an artificial neural network (ANN) model that used climatic variables for 6-hour (h) and daily G forecasting. The input variables included the six most relevant climate variables from Scientific Information for Land Owners (SILO) and 51 Reanalysis variables obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) models. This information was used to forecast G data obtained from the energy utility (Energex) at 8 stations in southeast Queensland, Australia, by utilizing statistically significant lagged cross-correlations of G with its predictor variables. The developed ANN model was then benchmarked against multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), multiple linear regression (MLR), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models using various statistical metrics, such as relative root-mean square error (RRMSE%). Additionally, this study developed a hybrid ANN model by combining the forecasts of the ANN, MARS, and MLR models. The bootstrap (B) technique was also used with the hybrid ANN model, creating the B-hybrid ANN, to estimate the forecast uncertainty. According to both forecast horizons, the results indicated that the ANN model was more accurate than the ARIMA, MARS, and MLR models for G forecasting. Furthermore, the hybrid ANN was the most accurate model developed in this research study. For example, at the best site (Redcliffe), the hybrid ANN model generated an RRMSE of 3.85% and 4.37% for the 6-h and daily horizons, respectively.

The proposed method aims to help farmers to obtain higher yield providing them with accurate planting date. For this purpose, metereological data was used as an input. For each year, metereological information (Daily Maximum Air Temperature, Daily Relative Humudity, Daily Average Air Temperature, Daily Minimum Air Temperature and Daily Precipitation) in the first 300 days were used to determine three different planting dates; early, normal and late for wheat crop. For estimation of planting date, classification algorithms of k Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Decisions Trees were used. Performances of different algorithms were calculated with leave one out cross validation approach. In order to eleminate extremely high processing time because of high dimension of the data set and improve estimation performance, genetic algorithm was used to reduce the number of features. For the estimations performed using both all features and also the features selected with genetic algorithm the highest accuracies were obtained using kNN method with classification accuracy rates of 37% and 92%, respectively.

We generated a unique multiresolution perturbed parameter ensemble of a global climate model. We use a novel application of a machine learning technique known as random forests to train a statistical model on the ensemble to make high-resolution model predictions of two important quantities: global mean top-of-atmosphere energy flux and precipitation. The random forests leverage cheaper low-resolution simulations, greatly reducing the number of high-resolution simulations required to train the statistical model. We demonstrate that high-resolution predictions of these quantities can be obtained by training on an ensemble that includes only a small number of high-resolution simulations.

Over the last decade, global scale models have produced varied predictions of the size and distribution of SOC stocks, ranging from 1000 to >3000 Pg of C within the top 1 m. Regional assessments may help validate or improve global maps because they can examine landscape controls on SOC stocks and offer a tractable means to retain regionally-specific information, such as soil taxonomy, during database creation and modeling. We compile a new transboundary SOC stock database for coastal watersheds of the North Pacific coastal temperate rainforest, using soil classification data to guide gap-filling and machine learning approaches to explore spatial controls on SOC and predict regional stocks. Precipitation and topographic attributes controlling soil wetness were found to be the dominant controls of SOC, underscoring the dependence of C accumulation on high soil moisture. The random forest model predicted stocks of 4.5 Pg C (to 1 m) for the study region, 22% of which was stored in organic soil layers. Calculated stocks of 228 ± 111 Mg C ha−1 fell within ranges of several past regional studies and indicate 11–33 Pg C may be stored across temperate rainforest soils globally. Predictions compared very favorably to regionalized estimates from two spatially-explicit global products (Pearson's correlation: ρ = 0.73 versus 0.34). Notably, SoilGrids 250 m was an outlier for estimates of total SOC, predicting 4-fold higher stocks (18 Pg C) and indicating bias in this global product for the soils of the temperate rainforest.

Here, we propose an automated method for recognizing atmospheric rivers (ARs) in climate data using topological data analysis and machine learning. The method provides useful information about topological features (shape characteristics) and statistics of ARs. We illustrate this method by applying it to outputs of version <span class=""inline-formula"">5.1</span> of the Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1 (CAM5.1) and the reanalysis product of the second Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2). An advantage of the proposed method is that it is threshold-free – there is no need to determine any threshold criteria for the detection method – when the spatial resolution of the climate model changes. Hence, this method may be useful in evaluating model biases in calculating AR statistics. Further, the method can be applied to different climate scenarios without tuning since it does not rely on threshold conditions. We show that the method is suitable for rapidly analyzing large amounts of climate model and reanalysis output data.</p>",2019/2/7,2021/10/6 16:59,2021/10/6 16:59,2021/10/6 16:59,613-628,,2,12,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,gmd.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/QUTDE3W6/Muszynski et al. - 2019 - Topological data analysis and machine learning for.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve data-composition scenarios and one optimized scenario were designed to explore the effects and synergetic use of nine Earth observation datasets, based on their reported potential in pixel-based classification.

While the RF classifier achieves a significantly higher overall accuracy and shows advantages in most of the individual classes, the SVM classifier exhibits significantly less variability with regard to accuracy.

Habitat models of these native vectors can be a helpful tool for assessing the risk of autochthonous occurrence, outbreaks and spread of diseases caused by such arboviruses. Modelling native mosquitoes is complicated because of the perfect adaptation to the climatic and landscape conditions and their high abundance in contrast to invasive species. Here we present a new approach for such a habitat model for native mosquito species in Germany, which are considered as vectors of West Nile virus (WNV). Epizootic emergence of WNV was registered in Germany since 2018. The models are based on surveillance data of mosquitoes from the German citizen science project “Mückenatlas” complemented by data from systematic trap monitoring in Germany, and on data freely available from the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) and OpenStreetMap (OSM). While climatic factors still play an important role, we could show that habitat suitability is predictable only by the combination of the climate model with a regional model. Both models were based on a machine-learning approach using XGBoost. Evaluation of the accuracy of the models was done by statistical analysis, determining among others feature importances using the SHAP-Library.

Based on multicollinearity test using the Variance Inflation Factor, four climatic factors and six landuse types were used as independent variables for NDVI simulation. The calibrated and validated statistical vegetation models denoted good performance using four machine learning algorithms. The ensemble results from the four machine learning modelling were used to assess the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature and precipitation change on annual and monthly scale. Based on historical climatic variability and future scenarios, eight hypothetical climatic scenarios for the changes in temperature and precipitation were used in this study. The results indicated that there were positive responses of NDVI to temperature and precipitation change. As an one °C increase in temperature, the NDVI was going to increase by 3.03%–5.79%, and it would increase by 3.35%–4.80% when the precipitation increased 10% in the YHHRB. Relatively, the NDVI was more sensitive to precipitation decrease than increase. The sensitivity of NDVI to temperature or precipitation was non-linear as temperature or precipitation changing for a specified climatic zone. Monthly, the sensitivity of NDVI to temperature change varied among the four climatic zones, but as precipitation increasing, the higher and lower sensitivity of NDVI were investigated in wetter and drier months, respectively.

One concern might be how well the trained neural networks could learn a dynamical system and what will be the potential application of this kind of learning. In this paper, three machine-learning methods are used: reservoir computer (RC), backpropagation-based (BP) artificial neural network, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. It shows that the coupling relations or dynamics among variables in linear or nonlinear systems can be inferred by RC and LSTM, which can be further applied to reconstruct one time series from the other. Specifically, we analyzed the climatic toy models to address two questions: (i) what factors significantly influence machine-learning reconstruction and (ii) how do we select suitable explanatory variables for machine-learning reconstruction. The results reveal that both linear and nonlinear coupling relations between variables do influence the reconstruction quality of machine learning. If there is a strong linear coupling between two variables, then the reconstruction can be bidirectional, and both of these two variables can be an explanatory variable for reconstructing the other. When the linear coupling among variables is absent but with the significant nonlinear coupling, the machine-learning reconstruction between two variables is direction dependent, and it may be only unidirectional. Then the convergent cross mapping (CCM) causality index is proposed to determine which variable can be taken as the reconstructed one and which as the explanatory variable. In a real-world example, the Pearson correlation between the average tropical surface air temperature (TSAT) and the average Northern Hemisphere SAT (NHSAT) is weak (0.08), but the CCM index of NHSAT cross mapped with TSAT is large (0.70).

To enhance the limited spectral information in RGB imagery, we derived spatial layers representing vegetation type and height and used landscape textures and diversity to predict hole parameters. Across-site models for hole density generally performed better than those for depth, where the best-performing model was for the invertebrate hole density (R2 = 0.62).

Small hydropower (SHP) can be a useful renewable energy source with a high energy density for the reduction of carbon emission. Therefore, it is necessary to revitalize the development of SHP to expand the use of renewable energy. To efficiently plan and utilize this energy source, there is a need to assess the future SHP potential based on an accurate runoff prediction. In this study, the future SHP potential was predicted using a climate change scenario and an artificial neural network model. The runoff was simulated accurately, and the applicability of an artificial neural network to the runoff prediction was confirmed. The results showed that the total amount of SHP potential in the future will generally a decrease compared to the past.

Rainfall is resulted from complex interactions between climate factors (air moisture, temperature, wind speed, etc.) and land surface (topography, soil, land cover, etc.). Therefore, deriving accurate areal rainfall is not only relied on atmospheric boundary conditions, but also on the reliability and availability of soils, topography, and vegetation data. Consequently, uncertainties in both atmospheric and land surface conditions contributes to rainfall model errors. In this study, a blended technique combining dynamical and statistical downscaling has been explored. The proposed downscaling approach uses input provided from three different global reanalysis data sets including ERA-Interim, ERA20C, and CFSR. These reanalysis atmospheric data are hybridly downscaled by means of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which is followed by the application of an artificial neural network (ANN) model to further downscale the WRF output to a finer resolution over the studied region. The proposed technique has been applied to the third largest river basin in Vietnam, the Sai Gon–Dong Nai Rivers Basin; and the calibration and validation show the simulation results agreed well with observation data. Results of this study suggest that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of simulated data, as it merges model simulations with observations over the modeled region. Another highlight of this approach is inexpensive computational demand on both computation times and output storage.",2021/6/5,2021/10/6 17:02,2021/10/6 17:02,2021/10/6 17:02,,,,,,Clim Dyn,Modeling high-resolution precipitation by coupling a regional climate model with a machine learning model,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While large-scale climate patterns such as teleconnections and climate change become important at this scale, it remains a challenge to represent the local hydrological cycle over various watersheds in a manner that is physically consistent with climate. As a result, global models tend to suffer from a lack of available scenarios and flexibility that are key for planners, relief organizations, regulators, and the financial services industry to analyze the socioeconomic, demographic, and climatic factors affecting exposure. Here we introduce a data-driven, global, fast, flexible, and climate-consistent flood risk modeling framework for applications that do not necessarily require high-resolution flood mapping. We use statistical and machine learning methods to examine the relationship between historical flood occurrence and impact from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (1985–2017), and climatic, watershed, and socioeconomic factors for 4,734 HydroSHEDS watersheds globally. Using bias-corrected output from the NCAR CESM Large Ensemble (1980–2020), and the fitted statistical relationships, we simulate 1 million years of events worldwide along with the population displaced in each event. We discuss potential applications of the model and present global flood hazard and risk maps. The main value of this global flood model lies in its ability to quickly simulate realistic flood events at a resolution that is useful for large-scale socioeconomic and financial planning, yet we expect it to be useful to climate and natural hazard scientists who are interested in socioeconomic impacts of climate.",2021,2021/10/6 17:03,2021/10/6 17:03,2021/10/6 17:03,e2020MS002221,,4,13,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020MS002221,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/2ZVQBGFG/Carozza i Boudreault - 2021 - A Global Flood Risk Modeling Framework Built With .pdf,,,flood determinants; flood risk management; global flood risk; statistical flood model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inspired by recent works that used machine learning algorithms for spatial downscaling, this paper proposes an alternative method to perform projections of precipitation intensity over short durations using machine learning.

To precisely analyze the effect of different climate factors on long-term GNSS monitoring records, this study combines the extended seven-parameter Helmert transformation and a machine learning algorithm named Extreme Gradient boosting (XGboost) to establish a hybrid model. We established a local-scale reference frame called stable Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands reference frame of 2019 (PRVI19) using ten continuously operating long-term GNSS sites located in the rigid portion of the Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands (PRVI) microplate. The stability of PRVI19 is approximately 0.4 mm/year and 0.5 mm/year in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The stable reference frame PRVI19 can avoid the risk of bias due to long-term plate motions when studying localized ground deformation. Furthermore, we applied the XGBoost algorithm to the postprocessed long-term GNSS records and daily climate data to train the model. We quantitatively evaluated the importance of various daily climate factors on the GNSS time series. The results show that wind is the most influential factor with a unit-less index of 0.013. Notably, we used the model with climate and GNSS records to predict the GNSS-derived displacements. The results show that the predicted displacements have a slightly lower root mean square error compared to the fitted results using spline method (prediction: 0.22 versus fitted: 0.31).

In this study, artificial neural networks are applied to predict the occurrence of a drought in two contrasting European domains, Munich and Lisbon, with a lead time of one month. The approach takes into account a list of 30 atmospheric and soil variables as input parameters from a single-model initial condition large ensemble (CRCM5-LE). The data was produced the context of the ClimEx project by Ouranos with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) driven by 50 members of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2). Drought occurrence was defined using the Standardized Precipitation Index. The best performing machine learning algorithms managed to obtain a correct classification of drought or no drought for a lead time of one month for around 55&ndash;60&thinsp;% of the events of each class for both domains. Explainable AI methods like SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were applied to gain a better understanding of the trained algorithms.

Downscaling models were calibrated over the period 1950–1991 and validated over the period 1992–2014 for each calendar month, for each station, using 4 machine learning techniques, (1) Genetic Programming (GP), (2) Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), (3) Support Vector Machine (SVM), and (4) Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). It was found that, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, downscaling models tend to better simulate the average (compared to other statistics) and under-estimate the standard deviation and the maximum of the observed precipitation. Also, irrespective of the climate regime and the machine learning technique, at the majority of stations downscaling models showed an over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles (i.e. below the 50th percentile) of precipitation and under-estimating trend of high percentiles of precipitation (i.e. above the 90th percentile). The over-estimating trend of low to mid percentiles of precipitation was more pronounced at stations located in dryer climate, irrespective of the machine learning technique. Based on the results of this investigation the use of RVM or ANN over SVM or GP for developing downscaling models can be recommended for a study such as flood prediction which involves the consideration of high extremes of precipitation. Also, RVM can be recommended over GP, ANN or SVM in developing downscaling models for a study such as drought analysis which involves the consideration of low extremes of precipitation.

These changes are also reflected in the dynamics of water-borne diseases as some of the causative agents of these illnesses are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and their survival rates are impacted by changes in climatic conditions. Previous studies have established strong relationships between essential climate variables and the coastal distribution and seasonal dynamics of the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, pathogenic types of which are responsible for human cholera disease. In this study we provide a novel exploration of the potential of a machine learning approach to forecast environmental cholera risk in coastal India, home to more than 200 million inhabitants, utilising atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic satellite-derived essential climate variables. A Random Forest classifier model is developed, trained and tested on a cholera outbreak dataset over the period 2010&ndash;2018 for districts along coastal India. The random forest classifier model has an Accuracy of 0.99, an F1 Score of 0.942 and a Sensitivity score of 0.895, meaning that 89.5% of outbreaks are correctly identified. Spatio-temporal patterns emerged in terms of the model&rsquo;s performance based on seasons and coastal locations. Further analysis of the specific contribution of each Essential Climate Variable to the model outputs shows that chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface salinity and land surface temperature are the strongest predictors of the cholera outbreaks in the dataset used. The study reveals promising potential of the use of random forest classifiers and remotely-sensed essential climate variables for the development of environmental cholera-risk applications. Further exploration of the present random forest model and associated essential climate variables is encouraged on cholera surveillance datasets in other coastal areas affected by the disease to determine the model&rsquo;s transferability potential and applicative value for cholera forecasting systems.",1月-20,2021/10/6 17:15,2021/10/6 17:15,2021/10/6 17:15,9378,,24,17,,,Cholera Risk,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 24 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/UZZF2JJ8/Campbell et al. - 2020 - Cholera Risk A Machine Learning Approach Applied .pdf,,,machine learning; random forest; climate; AI; cholera; coastal environment; essential climate variables; remote sensing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Higher resolution estimates are required for robust agricultural assessments at regional and local scales, where the applicability of GGCMs is often limited by low data availability and high computational demand. An approach to bridge this gap is the application of meta-models trained on GGCM output data to covariates of high spatial resolution. In this study, we explore two machine learning approaches – extreme gradient boosting and random forests - to develop meta-models for the prediction of crop model outputs at fine spatial resolutions. Machine learning algorithms are trained on global scale maize simulations of a GGCM and exemplary applied to the extent of Mexico at a finer spatial resolution. Results show very high accuracy with R2>0.96 for predictions of maize yields as well as the hydrologic externalities evapotranspiration and crop available water with also low mean bias in all cases. While limited sets of covariates such as annual climate data alone provide satisfactory results already, a comprehensive set of predictors covering annual, growing season, and monthly climate data is required to obtain high performance in reproducing climate-driven inter-annual crop yield variability.

This study aims to address this research gap through a case study of a residential building with 138 apartments in Doha, Qatar. Five parameters, including cooling setpoint, number of occupants, lighting power density, equipment power density, and interior solar reflectance, are selected as input parameters to create ninety-six different scenarios. Three machine-learning models are used as meta-models to generalize the relationship between cooling energy and the model parameters, including Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Artificial Neural Networks. The three meta-models’ prediction accuracies are evaluated by the Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE), Coefficient of Variation of the Root Mean Squared Error CV (RMSE), and R square (R2). The results show that the ANN model performs best. A new generic BEM is then established to validate the meta-model.

VWPTETJ9,thesis,2021,"Haggag, May",Enhancing urban centre resilience under climate-induced disasters using data analytics and machine learning techniques,,,,,https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/26912,"According to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, the global average number of CID has tripled in less than four decades (from approximately 1,300 Climate-Induced Disasters (CID) between 1975 and 1984 to around 3,900 between 2005 and 2014). In addition, around 1 million deaths and $1.7 trillion damage costs were attributed to CID since 2000, with around $210 billion incurred only in 2020. Consequently, the World Economic Forum identified extreme weather as the top ranked global risk in terms of likelihood and among the top five risks in terms of impact in the last 4 years. These risks are not expected to diminish as: i) the number of CID is anticipated to double during the next 13 years; ii) the annual fatalities due to CID are expected to increase by 250,000 deaths in the next decade; and iii) the annual CID damage costs are expected to increase by around 20% in 2040 compared to those realized in 2020. Given the anticipated increase in CID frequency, the intensification of CID impacts, the rapid growth in the world’s population, and the fact that two thirds of such population will be officially living in urban areas by 2050, it has recently become extremely crucial to enhance both community and city resilience under CID. Resilience, in that context, refers to the ability of a system to bounce back, recover or adapt in the face of adverse events. This is considered a very farfetched goal given both the extreme unpredictability of the frequency and impacts of CID and the complex behavior of cities that stems from the interconnectivity of their comprising infrastructure systems. With the emergence of data-driven machine learning which assumes that models can be trained using historical data and accordingly, can efficiently learn to predict different complex features, developing robust models that can predict the frequency and impacts of CID became more conceivable. Through employing data analytics and machine learning techniques, this work aims at enhancing city resilience by predicting both the occurrence and expected impacts of climate-induced disasters on urban areas. The first part of this dissertation presents a critical review of the research work pertaining to resilience of critical infrastructure systems. Meta-research is employed through topic modelling, to quantitatively uncover related latent topics in the field. The second part aims at predicting the occurrence of CID by developing a framework that links different climate change indices to historical disaster records. In the third part of this work, a framework is developed for predicting the performance of critical infrastructure systems under CID. Finally, the aim of the fourth part of this dissertation is to develop a systematic data-driven framework for the prediction of CID property damages. This work is expected to aid stakeholders in developing spatio-temporal preparedness plans under CID, which can facilitate mitigating the adverse impacts of CID on infrastructure systems and improve their resilience.",2021/9/29,2021/10/6 17:28,2021/10/6 17:28,2021/10/6 17:28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en_US,,Thesis,,,macsphere.mcmaster.ca,,Accepted: 2021-09-29T15:09:40Z,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, machine learning of nudging tendencies as functions of column state is used to correct the physical parameterization tendencies of temperature, humidity, and optionally winds, in a real-geography coarse-grid model (FV3GFS with a 200~km grid) to be closer to those of a 40-day reference simulation using X-SHiELD, a modified version of FV3GFS with a 3~km grid. Both simulations specify the same historical sea-surface temperature fields. This methodology builds on a prior study using a global observational analysis as the reference. The coarse-grid model without machine learning corrections has too little cloud, causing too much daytime heating of land surfaces that creates excessive surface latent heat flux and rainfall. This bias is avoided by learning downwelling radiative flux from the fine-grid model. The best configuration uses learned nudging tendencies for temperature and humidity but not winds. Neural nets slightly outperform random forests. Forecasts of 850 hPa temperature gain 18 hours of skill at 3--7 day leads and time-mean precipitation patterns are improved 30\% by applying the ML correction. Adding machine-learned wind tendencies improves 500 hPa height skill for the first five days of forecasts but degrades time-mean upper tropospheric temperature and zonal wind patterns thereafter.",2021/9/2,2021/10/6 17:29,2021/10/6 17:29,2021/10/6 17:29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EN,Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0),preprint,,,,,Archive Location: world Publisher: Earth and Space Science Open Archive Section: Atmospheric Sciences DOI: 10.1002/essoar.10507879.1,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/7ND99A99/essoar.10507879.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate such nonlinear relationship, we integrated a machine learning modeling framework based on the random forest (RF) algorithms with an interpretation framework to quantify the role of climate and catchment controls on hydrological drought. More particularly, our framework interprets a built RF machine-learning model to identify dominant variables and visualize their functional dependence and interaction effects on hydrological drought characteristics utilizing concepts of minimal depth, interactive depth, and partial dependence. We test our proposed modeling framework based on a set of 652 continental United States catchments with minimal human interference for a period of 1979–2010. Application of this framework indicated presence of three distinct drought regimes, which includes, Regime 1: droughts with longer duration, less frequent and lesser intensity; Regime 2: droughts with moderate duration, moderate frequency, and moderate intensity; and Regime 3: droughts with shorter duration, more frequent, and more intense. RF algorithm was able to accurately model the drought characteristics (intensity, duration, and number of events) for all the three drought regimes as a function of selected variables. It was observed that the type of dominant variables as well as their nonlinear functional relationship with hydrological droughts characteristics can vary between three selected regimes. Our interpretation framework indicated that catchment characteristics have a significant role in controlling the hydrologic drought for catchments (regime 1), whereas both climate and catchment characteristics control hydrological drought in regimes 2 and 3.",2020,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,e2018WR024620,,1,56,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018WR024620,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent events like the summer 2018 drought in Germany already had severe und unexpected impacts, e.g. forest fires and crop failures; in order to increase preparedness robust prediction tools are urgently required. In this study, machine learning methods are applied to predict the occurrence of a drought with lead times of one to three months. The approach takes into account a list of thirty atmospheric and soil variables as predictor input parameters from a single regional climate model initial condition large ensemble (CRCM5-LE). The data was produced the context of the ClimEx project by Ouranos with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5) driven by 50 members of the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM2) for the Bavarian and Quebec domains.Drought occurrence was defined using the Standardized Precipitation Index. The training and test datasets were chosen from the current climatology (1955-2005) for the Munich and Lisbon subdomain within the CRCM5-LE. The best performing machine learning algorithms managed to obtain a correct classification of drought or no drought for a lead time of one month for around 60 % of the events of each class for the both domains. Explainable AI methods like feature importance and shapley values were applied to gain a better understanding of the trained algorithms. Physical variables like the North Atlantic Oscillation Index and air pressure one month before the event proved to be of high importance for the prediction. The study showed that better accuracies can be obtained for the Lisbon domain, due to the stronger influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation Index on Portugal""s climate.",2021/4/1,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,EGU21-1305,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2021EGUGA..23.1305F,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cloud-resolving models better represent many of these processes and can now be run globally but only for short-term simulations of at most a few years because of computational limitations. Here we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to capture many advantages of cloud-resolving modeling at a fraction of the computational cost. We train a deep neural network to represent all atmospheric subgrid processes in a climate model by learning from a multiscale model in which convection is treated explicitly. The trained neural network then replaces the traditional subgrid parameterizations in a global general circulation model in which it freely interacts with the resolved dynamics and the surface-flux scheme. The prognostic multiyear simulations are stable and closely reproduce not only the mean climate of the cloud-resolving simulation but also key aspects of variability, including precipitation extremes and the equatorial wave spectrum. Furthermore, the neural network approximately conserves energy despite not being explicitly instructed to. Finally, we show that the neural network parameterization generalizes to new surface forcing patterns but struggles to cope with temperatures far outside its training manifold. Our results show the feasibility of using deep learning for climate model parameterization.

CZSL25XL,thesis,2021,"Choi, Kwanghun","Redistribution patterns of soil and soil nutrients : A study using process-oriented and machine-learning approaches, with applications to mountain catchments under monsoon climate",,,,,https://epub.uni-bayreuth.de/5368/,"Soil erosion is one of the significant environmental problems worldwide, causing surface soil degradation and freshwater deterioration. As the world’s population increases, the problem is worsening because erosion-resistant natural ecosystems are being converted into erosion- prone croplands to meet the increasing demands for food. South Korea is also suffering from recurrent severe soil erosion and consequent water deterioration in the monsoon season because of upland agricultural expansion driven by economic incentives. To define the optimal mitigation measures for soil erosion, we need tools that are suitable for upland agricultural areas. In this thesis, we focused on the spatial patterns of soil and soil organic matter containing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which are relevant to the soil erosion and water quality of mountainous catchments with complex terrain. Also, we aimed to propose measures to mitigate soil and soil organic matter exports to streams from mountainous catchments in the Soyang watershed by spatial reconfiguration of land use and land cover (LULC) at the landscape level. To investigate the spatial redistribution of soils and soil organic matter from mountain catchments, we developed a soil erosion model termed the Daily based Morgan–Morgan–Finney (DMMF) soil erosion model. The DMMF model was derived from the Modified Morgan–Morgan– Finney (MMMF) model, a variant of the well-known and widely used Morgan–Morgan–Finney (MMF) model, with modifications to make it suitable for complex terrain configurations under seasonal monsoon climates. While the MMMF model improved the physical foundations of the MMF model concerning topography, physical structures of vegetation, and subsurface interflow, several additional aspects needed to be corrected for a better representation of the physical processes. As the MMMF model was originated from an area with a simple terrain configu- ration and comparatively regular rainfall regimes, the model needed modification for a better representation of the study area, which has a complex terrain configuration under a seasonal monsoon climate. We identified and corrected the problematic aspects of the calculation in the effective rainfall, interflow, and transport capacity of the MMMF model by analyzing its entire process (chapter 2). In chapter three, we suggest a new soil erosion model, the DMMF model, based on the MMMF model. In chapter four, we evaluated the effect of a spatial reconfiguration of erosion hotspots on stream sediment load from an upland agricultural catchment utilizing the DMMF model. In this study, we estimated the sediment redistribution pattern and soil erosion risk on the Haean catchment, a well-known upland agricultural catchment belonging to the Soyang watershed. According to the results, the DMMF model can be applied to catchments with complicated terrain configurations affected by a monsoon climate. Results confirmed that a spatial recon- struction of the landscape, complementarily with other best management practices emphasizing the management of dry crop field, can be an effective method to reduce sediment yield from upland agricultural catchments such as Haean. In the final chapter five, we also investigate the environmental drivers that affect the spatial redistribution patterns of soil nutrients such as N and P in mountain forests. To achieve this goal, we used high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to derive detailed information regarding the topography and physical structure of vegetation. Then, we predicted the spatial patterns of soil nutrients such as N and P in the organic layer and mineral topsoil. Specifically, we analyzed the relative importance of vegetation and topographical parameters extracted from LiDAR for a better understanding of the spatial patterns of N and P. In addition, we identified areas with critical P contents and tested different validation strategies for N and P.",2021,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,,"XIV, 160",,,,,Redistribution patterns of soil and soil nutrients,,,,,,Bayreuth,de,urhg,Doctoral thesis,,,epub.uni-bayreuth.de,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/HXAIZF3Q/Choi - 2021 - Redistribution patterns of soil and soil nutrients.pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/BL8ULHS6/5368.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its core is a distributed, integrated surface-subsurface hydrological model in 500m horizontal resolution. With recent efforts, a version at a higher resolution of 100m was created. The higher resolution was, amongst others, desired by end-users and to better represent surface and surface-near phenomena such as the location of the uppermost groundwater table. Being presently located close to the surface across substantial parts of the country and partly expected to rise, the groundwater table and its future development due to climate change is of great interest. A rising groundwater table is associated with potential risks for infrastructure, agriculture and ecosystems. However, the 25-fold jump in resolution of the hydrological model also increases the computational effort. Hence, it was deemed unfeasible to run the 100m resolution hydrological model nation-wide with an ensemble of climate models to evaluate climate change impact. The full ensemble run could only be performed with the 500m version of the model. To still produce the desired outputs at 100m resolution, a downscaling method was applied as described in the following.Five selected subcatchment models covering around 9% of Denmark were run with five selected climate models at 100m resolution (using less than 3% of the computational time for hydrological models compared to a national, full ensemble run at 100m). Using the simulated changes at 100m resolution from those models as training data, combined with a set of covariates including the simulated changes in 500m resolution, Random Forest (RF) algorithms were trained to downscale simulated changes from 500m to 100m.Generalizing the trained RF algorithms, Denmark-wide maps of expected climate change induced changes to the shallow groundwater table at 100m resolution were modelled. To verify the downscaling results, amongst others, the RF algorithms were successfully validated against results from a sixth hydrological subcatchment model at 100m resolution not used in training the algorithms.The experience gained also opens for various other applications of similar algorithms where computational limitations inhibit running distributed hydrological models at fine resolutions: The results suggest the potential to downscale other model outputs that are desired at fine resolutions.",2021/4/1,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,2021/10/6 17:30,EGU21-7170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2021EGUGA..23.7170S,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study proposes two machine learning algorithms, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a novel simple tree-based ensemble method named Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), for accurate prediction of daily H using limited meteorological data. Daily H, maximum and minimum air temperatures (Tmax and Tmin), transformed precipitation (Pt, 1 for rainfall > 0 and 0 for rainfall = 0) and extra-terrestrial solar radiation (H0) during 1966–2000 and 2001–2015 from three radiation stations in humid subtropical China were used to train and test the models, respectively. Two combinations of input parameters, i.e. (i) only Tmax, Tmin and Ra, and (ii) complete data were considered for simulations. The proposed machine learning models were also compared with four well-known empirical models to evaluate their performances. The results suggest that the SVM and XGBoost models outperformed the selected empirical models. The performance of the machine learning models was improved by 5.9–12.2% for training phase and by 8.0–11.5% for testing phase in terms of RMSE when information of precipitation was further included. Compared with the SVM model, the XGBoost model generally showed better performance for training phase, and slightly weaker but comparable performance for testing phase in terms of accuracy. However, the XGBoost model was more stable with average increase of 6.3% in RMSE, compared to 10.5% for the SVM algorithm. Also, the XGBoost model (3.02 s and 0.05 s for training and testing phase, respectively) showed much higher computation speed than the SVM model (27.48 s and 4.13 s for training and testing phase, respectively).

Accelerating advances in remote sensing, including ever-increasing satellite missions, computational processing power, and modelling proficiency, are fueling a revolution in the estimation of global evapotranspiration at fine spatial resolutions. In this research, we develop statistical models to approximate high-resolution annual evapotranspiration rates under future climate scenarios to better understand the impact of climate change on the hydrologic cycle. We apply the latest version of the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model implemented within the inter-agency cooperative OpenET project to 26 regions across the conterminous United States, encompassing almost 2.2 million square kilometers. Using precipitation, temperature, and topography information, we train and test linear regression, classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest machine learning models to approximate SSEBop evapotranspiration for each of the National Land Cover Database vegetation classifications (excluding irrigated lands). By using only two temporally variant predictors (i.e. precipitation and temperature) and three temporally invariant predictors (i.e. elevation, slope, and aspect), trained models can be applied easily across a wide range of domain sizes. We investigate the use of these statistical models to approximate ET, as well as associated water balance-derived runoff.

Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors—including mean climate as well as climate extremes—explain 20%–49% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18%–43% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes.",2019/5/3,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,54010,,5,14,,Environ.

K.",Risk Analysis for Coastal Multi-hazard using Multiple Machine Learning Techniques under Climate Change,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFMNH23B1018S,"Recently, natural hazards have been more unpredictable with increasing frequency and strength due to climate change. Especially, coastal areas are becoming especially more vulnerable to future climate change impacts such as sea level rise and extreme weather events. This is a pertinent issue in the case of South Korea, as it is a peninsula where many large cities are located along with the coastal areas. Thus, a series of hazard prevention plans are necessary for the coastal areas, and the first step would be to find risk areas. The objective of this study is to find vulnerable areas that could be damaged by coastal hazards caused by typhoon and heavy rainfall. Coastal multi-hazard risk analysis was implemented by using multiple machine learning techniques such as Naïve-Bayes(NB), K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree(DT). These are mostly used in representative machine learning algorithms. In the case of NB, based on Bayes' Rule, the prior probability is used to estimate the posterior probability. The variables used for the analysis were collected and selected based on previous literature reviews: tide, significant wave height, elevation, slope, rainfall and so on. These variables were used to evaluate the posterior probability of coastal flooding events. The spatial scope of the research was set up as 1km from the coastline according to the 'coastal management law' in Korea. The results of risk analysis ranged from 0 to 1, where a higher probability indicates areas at higher risk of two extreme climate events, tide and heavy rainfall, occurring together. In addition, I did projection by using the Representative Concentration Pathway(RCP) climate change scenarios adopted by IPCC. According to the RCP scenarios, the risk increases in most of the coastal areas. In conclusion, the research is significant for finding potential flooding vulnerable area in the coastal zone, and the method could be applied in coastal planning like the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) of Korea considering the future climate impacts.",2019/12/1,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,NH23B-1018,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2019AGUFMNH23B1018S,,,,,4313 Extreme events; GLOBAL CHANGE; NATURAL HAZARDS; 1630 Impacts of global change; 4321 Climate impact; 4333 Disaster risk analysis and assessment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NFI3B6B7,journalArticle,2020,"Lee, Jin-Young",Estimating Design Floods using Machine Learning and Assessing Future Flood Risk considering Climate Change Scenarios,,,,,https://repository.hanyang.ac.kr/handle/20.500.11754/153237,"With recent climate change, rainfall patterns became irregular with increased frequency of heavy rainfalls and guerilla rainstorms (a short, torrential rain), which leads to increased flood damage. In case of Korea, with the increase in rainfall during the summer rainy season and rainfall intensity, the country is hit by the substantial flood damage every year. In order to reduce such flood damage and secure the stability of hydraulic structures, development of reliable design flood estimation method is necessary.  Despite the ongoing efforts to develop a design flood estimation method in Korea, it has been difficult to develop a standardized method that can be applied in practice due to the quantitative insufficiency of hydrologic data, in particular the flood data, and insufficient reliability  Internationally, flood frequency analysis (FFA) and regional frequency analysis (RFA) based on flood data are often used in combination, and in Europe, flow data is shared and guidelines on RFA is prepared and utilized.  In this regard, the trend of research is changing from point frequency analysis to RFA and from design rainfall-runoff analysis (DRRA) to FFA. However, research on the domestic application of RFA is still under progress, and there are limitations the applicability of RFA in that there are no standard for regional division in place and a methodology to taken into account the current status of rainfall data in Korea has not been established. In addition, DRRA is used in the comprehensive flood management plan of river basin, the largest-scale plan in the water resources sector in Korea, and FFA results are used for data verification. However, due to the tendency of overestimation in the probabilistic flood calculated by DRRA compared to the probabilistic flood calculated by FFA, there is a limit in its use as an adequate method of data verification.   The hydrologic unit map provided in Korea shows the regional division of watershed, mid-sized basin, and basins, and has been developed for joint utilization in relation to the collection and analysis of data used in the water resources projects for the efficient operation of water resources development, planning and management. However, in the comprehensive flood management plan of river basin, the plans are established based on the confluences of streams rather than to the hydrologic unit map, and thus the applicability of the hydrologic unit map is limited.  Therefore, it is necessary to develop flood estimation method considering the results of FFA method and DRRA method as well as the characteristics of watersheds taking into account its applicability in practice, and the risk analysis according to the climate change scenario is required.  In this study, a probabilistic flood prediction model was developed with application of machine learning techniques, and risk analysis was performed according to the future climate change scenario. For the probabilistic flood prediction model, depending on whether to apply principal component analysis (PCA), general linear regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine, deep neural network, Elman recurrent neural network, and Jordan recurrent neural network were used. With the comparative review with the FFA analysis results of observed flood data, we have developed probabilistic flood prediction model. With the developed model, thirteen climate change scenarios were applied to compare and evaluate the change in the risks by future time period. The future flood risk of Korea was analyzed to increase by 0.53%(representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5) and 8.68%(RCP 8.5) on average than the current level of risk when 100-year frequency was used. Therefore, it is thought to be the time when the estimation of design return period of hydraulic structures for future climate change and accurate probabilistic flood estimation are required.",8月-20,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,,,,,,머신 러닝 기법을 이용한 설계홍수량 추정 및 기후변화 시나리오에 따른 미래 홍수 위험도 평가,,,,,,,,ko,,,,,repository.hanyang.ac.kr,,Accepted: 2020-08-28T17:03:06Z Publisher: 한양대학교,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/J8SPYHXK/153237.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

J.",Parameterization of Autoconversion Rates in a Climate Model Using Machine Learning with Training from Large Eddy Simulations,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMA071...04P,"Phenomenologically, cloud water autoconversion is the rate at which cloud droplets grow into raindrops, predominantly through collision-coalescence. As autoconversion helps control cloud lifetime, by controlling the rate at which cloud water is depleted through precipitation, parameterization of autoconversion plays an important role in determining a climate model's climate sensitivity. The rate at which cloud droplets collide and coalesce depends on many factors that are not explicitly treated in climate models. For this reason, many atmospheric models rely on empirical relations to represent autoconversion that are obtained through curve fits to data from a relatively limited number of idealized simulations that explicitly resolve autoconversion processes. Here we discuss our experience leveraging a new large eddy simulation capability, called Predicting INteractions of Aerosol and Clouds in Large Eddy Simulation (PINACLES), that is equipped with spectral bin microphysics to explicitly simulate autoconversion processes to generate training data for deep neural networks (DNN) that we then use to parameterize autoconversion processes in the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). In particular, we will describe our end-to-end workflow from the generation of training datasets spanning a range of boundary layer cloud types, to the training of deep neural networks, and finally to the implementation in a climate model. Further, we will assess the impact of these new DNN-based parametrizations on aerosol-induced change of cloud and precipitation properties, the effective radiative forcing (ERF) associated with aerosol-cloud interactions (ERFaci), and the simulated climate.",2020/12/1,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,2021/10/6 17:35,A071-04,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020AGUFMA071...04P,,,,,3360 Remote sensing; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES; 3311 Clouds and aerosols; 3359 Radiative processes; 3336 Numerical approximations and analyses,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, today the large government forecast centers almost exclusively rely on complex fully coupled dynamical forecast systems for their subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) predictions while statistical techniques are mostly neglected and those techniques still in use have not been updated in decades. In this Opinion Article, we argue that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science, collectively referred to as machine learning, can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of S2S predictions. We present an example of where unsupervised learning demonstrates higher accuracy in a seasonal prediction than the state-of-the-art dynamical systems. We also summarize some relevant machine learning methods that are most applicable to climate prediction. Finally, we show by comparing real-time dynamical model forecasts with observations from winter 2017/2018 that dynamical model forecasts are almost entirely insensitive to polar vortex (PV) variability and the impact on sensible weather. Instead, statistical forecasts more accurately predicted the resultant sensible weather from a mid-winter PV disruption than the dynamical forecasts. The important implication from the poor dynamical forecasts is that if Arctic change influences mid-latitude weather through PV variability, then the ability of dynamical models to demonstrate the existence of such a pathway is compromised. We conclude by suggesting that S2S prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning.

However, even in this case, hourly data may be available since low-cost sensors can report hourly measurements. This study evaluates, for the first time, in regional and local scenarios, the use of limited hourly meteorological data (temperature and relative humidity or only temperature) to estimate daily ETo directly and by summing hourly ETo values, employing RF, XGBoost, ANN and CNN. The following options were evaluated: (i) use of daily input data (conventional approach); (ii) use of hourly data measured during a 24 h period + hourly extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) to estimate daily ETo directly; (iii) the same configuration of the last option, but with daily Ra instead of hourly Ra; and (iv) use of hourly data to estimate hourly ETo and then to estimate daily ETo by summing hourly ETo. All options used Ra. To develop and evaluate the models, two daily ETo targets were considered: ETod (computed using the daily version of the ASCE-PM equation) and ETosoh (computed by summing hourly ETo obtained with the ASCE-PM equation). Data from 53 weather stations located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, were used. For all models, the best results were found using hourly data to estimate daily ETo directly. CNN models developed with 24 h hourly data + hourly Ra offered the best performance in all cases. In relation to the best models developed with daily data, RMSE reduced by up to 28.2 % (0.71 to 0.51) and NSE and R2 increased by up to 21.7 (0.69 to 0.84) and 11.4 % (0.79 to 0.88), respectively, in regional scenario.

Prominent examples include modulations of the tropospheric and stratospheric circulation, climate sensitivity, cloud formation, and stratospheric water vapour (e.g. [1-8]). Here I first revisit some recent work providing evidence for such effects. I then provide an update on a recently developed machine learning parameterization for ozone using the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1, [9]). Such a parameterization could adequately represent ozone feedbacks without adding the high computational expense of a fully interactive atmospheric chemistry scheme. The parameterization could also provide several notable scientific advantages, for example concerning the treatment of important chemistry-climate model biases. Finally, I put my results into the context of several other methods suggested as potential means for addressing ozone-related effects in idealized climate sensitivity simulations, also considering the still substantial uncertainties related to modelling ozone [10,11] and associated climate feedbacks [5,12].References:[1] Son et al.

There are some approaches to regionalize climates such as rule- and clustering-based classification using temperature and precipitation data. Among them, Köppen-Geiger (K-G) climate classification has been widely used by researchers across a range of disciplines as a basis of the climatic characteristics of regions. However, because Köppen-Geiger (K-G) climate data have relatively course spatial resolution (0.05-, 0.17 and 0.08 degree, it is not often suitable for local to regional applications such as the Korean Peninsula, which has rugged and complex terrains. The purpose of this study is to classify climate regions at 1 km spatial resolution from satellite-based data using several state-of-the-art machine learning methods over the Korean Peninsula. The land surface temperature (T) provided by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the precipitation(P) provided by Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) from 2001 to 2016 were used for calculating input variables such as annual mean of T and sum of P, max and min of T and P for each summer (from May to October) and winter (from November to April). Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation models (DEM) were also used to consider the terrains. The target variable was generated by rule of the K-G climate model at weather stations (a total of 90). Random forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied to develop climate classification models. Results showed that overall accuracy of RF and ANN models was relatively high with some modeling errors caused by the small number of training samples for a few climate classes. The major difference between our models and the K-G climate classification model was found in mountainous areas with complex terrains. The results provided climate regions with much more detailed spatial variations at high resolution (i.e., at a sub-city scale) than the existing data. In addition, a temporal trend of climate regions over the Korean Peninsula was also examined.",2018/12/1,2021/10/6 17:37,2021/10/6 17:37,2021/10/6 17:37,T31E-0361,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2018AGUFM.T31E0361P,,,,,3399 General or miscellaneous; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSESDE: 1699 General or miscellaneous; GLOBAL CHANGEDE: 3099 General or miscellaneous; MARINE GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICSDE: 8099 General or miscellaneous; STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study proposed two optimization methods, i.e., particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), to determine the input weights and hidden biases of extreme learning machine (ELM), and developed two novel hybrid GA-ELM and PSO-ELM models for ETo estimations with limited input data. A temporal and spatial scanning strategy that can avoid misleading or partially valid results was applied to train and test the models, using daily climatic data during 1994–2016 from 96 meteorological stations across various climates of China. The results revealed that GA-ELM and PSO-ELM could quantify ETo on daily, monthly, and annual time scales, with GA-ELM (with model efficiency ranging from 0.80 to 0.97) performing better than PSO-ELM (with model efficiency ranging from 0.70 to 0.93) in all climates. The temperature-based GA-ELM only with air temperature data as forcing input has relatively accurate ETo estimates across different environments, and can be recommended as an alternative method when radiation data are not available. Spatial assessment reveals that the machine learning models trained by external data also offer accurate ETo estimates, confirming the applicability of models for ETo estimations elsewhere without the model training or when local data for model training are unavailable. Overall, the GA-ELM model provides accurate ETo estimates on various time scales and exhibits superior performance than the PSO-ELM model, and thus can be recommended for ETo estimations using limited data as model forcing in different climates of China. Our work presents a novel method for accurate ETo estimations with limited data, which has practical implications in regional agricultural water management.",2021/8/1,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,106294,,,187,,Computers and Electronics in Agriculture,Extreme learning machine for reference crop evapotranspiration estimation,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Machine learning; Genetic algorithm; Extreme learning machine; Particle swarm optimization; Reference crop evapotranspiration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9RP9FVW9,journalArticle,2018,"Brown, M. G. L.; Wang, D.; Liang, S.",Intercomparison of machine learning algorithms for satellite derived estimates of essential climate variables,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMGC44D..31B,"Satellite derived estimates of downward shortwave radiation (DSR) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) are a part of the surface radiation budget, an essential climate variable (ECV) required by many models for the climate system. Ground measurements are insufficient for generating long term, global measurements of surface radiation, due to spatial limitations and the high cost of maintaining the instruments long term. In order to obtain global coverage of DSR and PAR estimates satellite observations are necessary. Frequently, satellite derived DSR and PAR estimates are generated by computing the radiative transfer inversion of top of atmosphere (TOA) measurements, and requires ancillary data on the atmospheric condition. To reduce computational costs, often the radiative transfer calculations are done offline and large look up tables (LUTs) are generated so the estimates can be derived more quickly. Recently studies have begun exploring the use of machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and others to try to improve computational efficiency. Here nine machine learning methods were tested for estimating DSR and PAR using only TOA radiance from MODIS and satellite viewing geometry are used as input to the models. The aim was to reduce the input data requirements in order to create the simplest robust model possible. The Bagging Tree model, Gaussian Process Regression model, and simple Neural Network yielded the best results with minimal training; with an R2 of .77, .78, .78, a bias of -8, -5, -4 W/m2, and RMSE of 23%, 23%, 22%, respectively for all sky condition and viewing angles less than 55 degrees. Viewing angles above 55 degrees were excluded because the residual analysis showed exponential error growth above 55 degrees. These results can be improved with additional training, but the focus here was to understand which models produced the best results and why. A simple, robust model for estimating DSR and PAR using machine learning methods is useful for a variety of climate system studies. Future studies may focus on developing high temporal resolution direct and diffuse estimates of DSR and PAR as most current models estimate only total DSR or PAR.",2018/12/1,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,GC44D-31,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2018AGUFMGC44D..31B,,,,,INFORMATICS; 0321 Cloud/radiation interaction; ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND STRUCTUREDE: 1605 Abrupt/rapid climate change; GLOBAL CHANGEDE: 1640 Remote sensing; GLOBAL CHANGEDE: 1952 Modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Biomass sorghum has become a feedstock crop of particular interest because of its drought tolerance and familiarity to U.S. farmers, with recent large investments by the U.S. Department of Energy. Unlike many promising bioenergy crops, which have not been grown for commercial production, historical sorghum yield records can be used to understand the interplay between soil types, climatic variables, and farmer behavior that in turn determine yield. Furthermore, understanding how biomass sorghum will perform under climate change, and what historical data can teach us about likely farmer behavior and resulting yield variation, can provide valuable insight into sorghum's role in the bioeconomy. We used a variation on Random Forest regression to predict future trends in sorghum biomass yields under four different greenhouse gas emission scenarios and two irrigation regimes. Irrigation practices, growing season vapor pressure deficit, and time (a proxy for technological improvement) were revealed as the most important predictors. Our results showed a decreasing trend of sorghum yields over future years (on average 2.7% from 2018 to 2099), with greater decline under a high emissions scenario (3.8%) and in the absence of irrigation (4.6%). We also observed geographical differences in future sorghum biomass yield. Specifically, our model projected greatest yield declines in the Great Lakes, Upper Midwest, and Heartland regions while forecasting moderate declines in all other parts of the U.S. except the Mountain region where a slight increasing trend in yields was predicted. In general, our model suggests much more stability in yield across regions, even in rainfed-only scenarios, compared to other recent studies. Our results also indicate that purely mechanistic models tend to predict greater regional variation in yields relative to our regression model trained on historical data.",2019/12/1,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,GC41H-1248,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2019AGUFMGC41H1248S,,,,,GLOBAL CHANGE; 1640 Remote sensing; HYDROLOGY; 1616 Climate variability; 1807 Climate impacts; 6309 Decision making under uncertainty; POLICY SCIENCES,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, we present global maps at 500 m resolution of specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content per dry mass, and leaf nitrogen/phosphorus ratio. The processing chain exploits machine learning techniques along with optical remote sensing data (MODIS/Landsat) and climate data for gap filling and up-scaling of in-situ measured leaf traits. The chain first uses random forests regression with surrogates to fill gaps in the database (> 45% of missing entries) and maximizes the global representativeness of the trait dataset. Plant species are then aggregated to Plant Functional Types (PFTs). Next, the spatial abundance of PFTs at MODIS resolution (500 m) is calculated using Landsat data (30 m). Based on these PFT abundances, representative trait values are calculated for MODIS pixels with nearby trait data. Finally, different regression algorithms are applied to globally predict trait estimates from these MODIS pixels using remote sensing and climate data. The methods were compared in terms of precision, robustness and efficiency. The best model (random forests regression) shows good precision (normalized RMSE≤ 20%) and goodness of fit (averaged Pearson's correlation R = 0.78) in any considered trait. Along with the estimated global maps of leaf traits, we provide associated uncertainty estimates derived from the regression models. The process chain is modular, and can easily accommodate new traits, data streams (traits databases and remote sensing data), and methods. The machine learning techniques applied allow attribution of information gain to data input and thus provide the opportunity to understand trait-environment relationships at the plant and ecosystem scales. The new data products – the gap-filled trait matrix, a global map of PFT abundance per MODIS gridcells and the high-resolution global leaf trait maps – are complementary to existing large-scale observations of the land surface and we therefore anticipate substantial contributions to advances in quantifying, understanding and prediction of the Earth system.",2018/12/1,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,2021/10/6 17:38,69-88,,,218,,Remote Sensing of Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/F6H3PUMB/Moreno-Martínez et al. - 2018 - A methodology to derive global maps of leaf traits.pdf,,,Machine learning; Random forests; Remote sensing; Climate; Landsat; MODIS; Plant ecology; Plant traits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is essential to enhance the resilience of our C.I to withstand such events in the present and future. Here, a review of current and projected impacts of climate change is conducted on extreme events and on possible implications on C.I is carried out, which suggests that such events can have a severe impact on C.Is. Also, two studies on the behaviour of precipitation extremes and temporal evolution of drought across India are carried out, taking into account the corresponding impacts on C.Is. It indicated that north-western, north-eastern westernmost regions and western Ghats are highly susceptible to floods and northern, central-eastern, western, and central regions are prone towards co-occurrence of floods and droughts. Also, a case study on Kharif paddy yield forecasting using different machine learning (ML) models is carried out, where the random forest was found to be the most suitable model for yield prediction.

Here, we show that in climate research, intermediate categories exist between classical domain science and big data, and that big-data elements have also been applied without the possibility of repeated evaluation.

However, on a smaller pixel and temporal scale these ‘climate-scapes’ are often less studied, are poorly understood and assessments are lacking. The accuracy of climate-scapes is often affected by local topography and wider couplings. The science of local climate-scapes is still in its infancy, so are the methods of inquiry and inference for ‘weather’. This chapter presents an example for southern Alaska on how differences between regionalized IPCC and other widely used climate models can be data mined, described, assessed and predicted for a better and more informative outcome of climate-scapes. The approach presented here is based on a TreeNet machine learning algorithm using Salford Predictive Modeler Suite 8 (SPM8). These methods allow to locate disagreements in models beyond ‘just’ the means. The models are primarily based on elevation and slope; however other covariates are important such as month (July/January), landcover (shrub and closed mixed forest), aspect, proximity to roads and rivers, and coastal islands. Based on these findings thorough but rapid assessment of ‘climate-scapes’ and their models’ performances and error patterns (explicit in space and time) are recommended for an improved understanding and repeatable and transparent science, its methodology and inference. These methods also enable the ability to address key questions of whether climate and local weather are affected by large-scale macro patterns or regionally driven (bottom-up).",2018,2021/10/6 17:39,2021/10/6 17:39,2021/10/6 17:39,227-241,,,,,,Advanced Data Mining (Cloning) of Predicted Climate-Scapes and Their Variances Assessed with Machine Learning,,,,,Springer International Publishing,Cham,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-96978-7_11,,,,,Prediction; Analysis rules; Climate-scapes; Complex data; Data cloning; Data mining; Inference; Local climate; Topography,"Humphries, Grant; Magness, Dawn R.; Huettmann, Falk",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because of the inherent complexities of such data, which are often spatio-temporal, chaotic, and non-stationary, the CNN algorithms must be designed/evaluated for each specific dataset and application. Yet CNN, being a supervised technique, requires a large labeled dataset to start. Labeling demands (human) expert time which, combined with the limited number of relevant examples in this area, can discourage using CNNs for new problems. To address these challenges, here we (1) Propose an effective auto-labeling strategy based on using an unsupervised clustering algorithm and evaluating the performance of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting these clusters up to 5 days ahead of time; (2) Use this approach to label thousands of daily large-scale weather patterns over North America in the outputs of a fully-coupled climate model and show the capabilities of CNNs in re-identifying and predicting the 4 clustered regimes up to 5 days ahead of time. The deep CNN trained with 1000 samples or more per cluster has an accuracy of 90% or better for both identification and prediction while prediction accuracy scales weakly with the number of lead days. Accuracy scales monotonically but nonlinearly with the size of the training set, e.g. reaching 94% with 3000 training samples per cluster for identification and 93–76% for prediction at lead day 1–5, outperforming logistic regression, a simpler machine learning algorithm, by  ~ 25%.

While much of the extant literature has been devoted to the individual explanatory potential of individuals’ characteristics, we focus on the extent to which these characteristics provide robust predictions of climate and environmental attitudes.

To do so, we use a popular machine learning technique, Random Forests, on three surveys fielded in China, Switzerland, and the USA, using a variety of outcome variables.
