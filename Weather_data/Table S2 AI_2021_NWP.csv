The Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model has been widely used for forecasting air temperature, but generally it has a systematic bias due to its coarse grid resolution and lack of parametrizations. This study used random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and a multi-model ensemble (MME) to correct the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS; a local NWP model over Korea) model outputs of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures ( and ) in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 14 LDAPS model forecast data, the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of in-situ observations, and five auxiliary data were used as input variables. The results showed that the LDAPS model had an R2 of 0.69, a bias of −0.85 °C and an RMSE of 2.08 °C for forecast, whereas the proposed models resulted in the improvement with R2 from 0.75 to 0.78, bias from −0.16 to −0.07 °C and RMSE from 1.55 to 1.66 °C by hindcast validation. For forecasting , the LDAPS model had an R2 of 0.77, a bias of 0.51 °C and an RMSE of 1.43 °C by hindcast, while the bias correction models showed R2 values ranging from 0.86 to 0.87, biases from −0.03 to 0.03 °C, and RMSEs from 0.98 to 1.02 °C. The MME model had better generalization performance than the three single machine learning models by hindcast validation and leave-one-station-out cross-validation.",2020,2021/10/6 11:48,2021/10/6 11:48,2021/10/6 11:48,e2019EA000740,,4,7,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019EA000740,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/M52CTTPI/2019EA000740.html; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/MKFZRRC8/Cho et al. - 2020 - Comparative Assessment of Various Machine Learning.pdf,,,random forest; Air temperature forecast; artificial neural networks; bias correction; multi-model ensemble; support vector regression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The selection of the physical schemes and the choice of the corresponding physical parameters during model configuration can significantly impact the accuracy of model forecasts. There is no combination of physical schemes that works best for all times, at all locations, and under all conditions. It is therefore of considerable interest to understand the interplay between the choice of physics and the accuracy of the resulting forecasts under different conditions. This paper demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to study the uncertainty in numerical weather prediction models due to the interaction of multiple physical processes. The first problem addressed herein is the estimation of systematic model errors in output quantities of interest at future times, and the use of this information to improve the model forecasts. The second problem considered is the identification of those specific physical processes that contribute most to the forecast uncertainty in the quantity of interest under specified meteorological conditions. In order to address these questions we employ two machine learning approaches, random forests and artificial neural networks. The discrepancies between model results and observations at past times are used to learn the relationships between the choice of physical processes and the resulting forecast errors. Numerical experiments are carried out with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The output quantity of interest is the model precipitation, a variable that is both extremely important and very challenging to forecast. The physical processes under consideration include various micro-physics schemes, cumulus parameterizations, short wave, and long wave radiation schemes.

The reference evapotranspiration (ET0) is particularly important in the croplands because it is a convenient and reasonable method for calculating the actual evapotranspiration (AET) that represents the loss of water in the croplands through the soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration. To date, many efforts have been made to retrieve ET0 on a spatially continuous grid. In particular, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product is provided with a reasonable spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of 8 days. However, the applicability to the local-scale variabilities due to complex and heterogeneous land surfaces in countries like South Korea is not sufficiently validated. Meanwhile, the AI approaches showed a useful functionality for the ET0 retrieval on the local scale but have rarely demonstrated a substantial product for a spatially continuous grid. This paper presented a retrieval of the daily reference evapotranspiration (ET0) over a 500 m grid for croplands in South Korea using machine learning (ML) with satellite images and numerical weather prediction data. In a blind test for 2013&ndash;2019, the ML-based ET0 model produced the accuracy statistics with a root mean square error of 1.038 mm/day and a correlation coefficient of 0.870. The results of the blind test were stable irrespective of location, year, and month. This outcome is presumably because the input data of the ML-based ET0 model were suitably arranged spatially and temporally, and the optimization of the model was appropriate. We found that the relative humidity and land surface temperature were the most influential variables for the ML-based ET0 model, but the variables with lower importance were also necessary to consider the nonlinearity between the variables. Using the daily ET0 data produced over the 500 m grid, we conducted a case study to examine agrometeorological characteristics of the croplands in South Korea during the period when heatwave and drought events occurred. Through the experiments, the feasibility of the ML-based ET0 retrieval was validated, especially for local agrometeorological applications in regions with heterogeneous land surfaces, such as South Korea.",1月-20,2021/10/6 11:49,2021/10/6 11:49,2021/10/6 11:49,3642,,21,12,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 21 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/S3BDWY7E/Kim et al. - 2020 - Retrieval of Daily Reference Evapotranspiration fo.pdf,,,machine learning; agrometeorology; cropland; evapotranspiration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NSH9VP6S,webpage,,,Using Machine-Learning Methods to Improve Surface Wind Speed from the Outputs of a Numerical Weather Prediction Model | SpringerLink,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10546-020-00586-x,"The relationship between the wind speed derived from the outputs of a numerical-weather-prediction model and from observations is explored using statistical and machine-learning models. Eight years of wind-speed measurements at a height of 10 m (from 2010 to 2017) from 171 stations spread over mainland France and Corsica are used for reference. Operational analyses from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) provide the model information not only on the surface flow, but on other aspects of the atmospheric state at the location (or above) each station. In a first step, a large number of explanatory variables are used as input to several models (linear regressions, k-nearest neighbours, random forests, and gradient boosting). The modelled wind speed in the ECMWF analyses, by itself, has root-mean-square errors over all stations distributed widely around a median of 1.42 m s−1. Using statistical post-processing and making use of a historical dataset for training, the median of the root-mean-square errors at all stations can be reduced down to 1.07 m s−1 when modelled with linear regressions, and down to 0.94 m s−1 with the machine-learning models (random forests or gradient boosting). Yet more significant decreases are found for coastal stations where the errors are largest. The random-forest models are further explored to reduce the list of explanatory variables: a list of 25 explanatory variables, mainly consisting of flow variables (wind speed, velocity components, horizontal gradients of geopotential on different isobaric surfaces, wind shear between 10 and 100 m) and including marginally some temperature variables, appears as a good compromise between performance and simplicity. Finally, as a preliminary test for further work, the relation thus captured between the model outputs and the observed wind speed at a given time is applied to forecasts of the numerical-weather-prediction model, for lead times up to 24 h. The machine-learning model is found to be essentially as relevant on the forecasts as it was on the analyses, encouraging further use and development of these approaches for local wind-speed forecasts.",,2021/10/6 11:49,2021/10/6 11:50,2021/10/6 11:49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/48RIZPV9/s10546-020-00586-x.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models at the mesoscale represent a valuable way to characterize the wind resource offshore, given the challenges connected with measuring hub height wind speed. The boundary condition and parametric uncertainty associated with modeled wind speed is often estimated by running a model ensemble. However, creating an NWP ensemble of long-term wind resource data over a large region represents a computational challenge. Here, we propose two approaches to temporally extrapolate wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty using a more convenient setup where a mesoscale ensemble is run over a short-term period (1 year), and only a single model covers the desired long-term period (20 year). We quantify hub-height wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty from the short-term model ensemble as its normalized across-ensemble standard deviation. Then, we develop and apply a gradient-boosting model and an analog ensemble approach to temporally extrapolate such uncertainty to the full 20-year period, where only a single model run is available. As a test case, we consider offshore wind resource characterization in the California Outer Continental Shelf. Both the proposed approaches provide accurate estimates of the long-term wind speed boundary condition and parametric uncertainty across the region (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup>&thinsp;&gt;&thinsp;0.75), with the gradient-boosting model slightly outperforming the analog ensemble in terms of bias and centered root-mean-square error. At the three offshore wind energy lease areas in the region, we find a long-term median hourly uncertainty between 10&thinsp;% and 14&thinsp;% of the mean hub-height wind speed values. Finally, we assess the physical variability of the uncertainty estimates. In general, we find that the wind speed uncertainty increases closer to land. Also, neutral conditions have smaller uncertainty than the stable and unstable cases, and the modeled wind speed in winter has less boundary condition and parametric sensitivity than summer.</p>",2021/5/11,2021/10/6 11:50,2021/10/6 11:50,2021/10/6 11:50,22-1月,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,wes.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/7W795SKI/Bodini et al. - 2021 - Assessing Boundary Condition and Parametric Uncert.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dramatic increase of wind power penetration in electricity production has posed a big challenge to grid integration due to the high uncertainty of wind power. Accurate real-time forecasts of wind farm power outputs can help to mitigate the problem. Among the various techniques developed for wind power forecasting, the hybridization of numerical weather prediction (NWP) and machine learning (ML) techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) are attracting many researchers world-wide nowadays, because it has the potential to yield more accurate forecasts. In this paper, two hybrid NWP and ANN models for wind power forecasting over a highly complex terrain are proposed. The developed models have a fine temporal resolution and a sufficiently large prediction horizon (&gt;6 h ahead). Model 1 directly forecasts the energy production of each wind turbine. Model 2 forecasts first the wind speed, then converts it to the power using a fitted power curve. Effects of various modeling options (selection of inputs, network structures, etc.) on the model performance are investigated. Performances of different models are evaluated based on four normalized error measures. Statistical results of model predictions are presented with discussions. Python was utilized for task automation and machine learning. The end result is a fully working library for wind power predictions and a set of tools for running the models in forecast mode. It is shown that the proposed models are able to yield accurate wind farm power forecasts at a site with high terrain and flow complexities. Especially, for Model 2, the normalized Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Squared Error are obtained as 8.76% and 13.03%, respectively, lower than the errors reported by other models in the same category.",1月-21,2021/10/6 11:51,2021/10/6 11:51,2021/10/6 11:51,338,,2,14,,,,,,,,,,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,www.mdpi.com,,Number: 2 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/N4ZNH7XP/Donadio et al. - 2021 - Numerical Weather Prediction and Artificial Neural.pdf,,,artificial neural network; numerical weather prediction; wind power forecasting; complex terrain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, a novel machine learning model, i.e., extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), was proposed to downscale and bias correct the GEFS forecasts. The results showed that the GEFS forecasts downscaled by the XGBoost model were more accurate than those downscaled by the inverse distance weighting (IDW) and equidistant cumulative distribution functions matching (EDCDFm) methods, with decreases in mean RMSE of maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (Ws) and solar radiation (Rs) by 36.2%, 33.5%, 35.7%, 75.0% and 27.0%, and by 11.2%, 13.3%, 14.0%, 26.4% and 13.2%, resulting in decreases in mean RMSE of ET0 by 35.0% and 18.2%, respectively.

Nationally averaged RMSE values of daily ET0 for 16 d lead time (1.0 mm d−1) and 8 d lead time (0.9 mm d−1) were approximately 1.7 and 1.5 times of that for 1 d lead time (0.6 mm d−1), respectively. Average R2 values of ET0 across China varied 0.56–0.85 for 1–16 d lead times, while the corresponding NRMSE values ranged 0.22–0.38, with more accurate ET0 estimates in the temperate continental zone (TCZ) and mountain plateau zone (MPZ) than the temperate monsoon zone (TMZ) and (sub)tropical monsoon zone (SMZ). The forecasting performance of seasonal ET0 was generally better in summer, followed by autumn, spring and winter. The greatest reduction in the forecasting performance of daily ET0 was produced by the forecasting error of Rs in all climatic zones, followed by Ws, Tmax and RH in TCZ and MPZ, and by RH, Ws and Tmax in TMZ and SMZ; however, the influence of Tmin was marginal in all climatic zones. The results indicated that daily ET0 across China can be satisfactorily forecasted using the GEFS outputs downscaled by the XGBoost model, particularly for 1–8 d lead times.",2021/10/1,2021/10/6 12:26,2021/10/6 12:26,2021/10/6 12:26,126664,,,601,,Journal of Hydrology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/24A7JQE7/S0022169421007125.html,,,Forecasting; Lead time; Numerical weather prediction; Reference evapotranspiration; XGBoost model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the improvement of hydrological models, the precipitation forecast may be the largest source of uncertainty. Therefore, before incorporating it into the hydrological model, the precipitation forecast needs post-processing to reduce its uncertainty. Meteorological post-processing corrects the bias of future precipitation forecasts by establishing a linear or non-linear relationship between historical observation and simulation. Machine learning (ML) can fit this relationship and process higher-dimensional predictor features, which is a promising method to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts. In this study, we selected the Yalong River basin of China as the cast study and compared the performance of 20 different machine learning algorithms (e.g., ridge regression, random forest, and artificial neural network). The daily hindcast data (1985-2018) from NOAA""s Global ensemble forecast system and corresponding observations from the China Meteorological Administration were selected to construct our data set. To improve the accuracy of the precipitation forecasts, we also screened different combinations of predictors to optimize the model configuration of machine learning, including space, time, and ensemble members. Comparative experiments show that all ML models can improve the accuracy of the raw precipitation forecast, but the performance is different. The extra-trees model has the best results, followed by LightGBM. However, linear regression models perform relatively poorly. The predictor combination of 11 ensemble members and a 2-day time window can achieve the best precipitation forecast. The post-processing of precipitation forecasts based on ML can significantly improve the accuracy of the raw forecasts, and it can also help us build a more advanced hydrological forecast system.

The aim of this research is to propose a weather prediction model for short-range prediction based on numerical data. Daily weather prediction includes the work of thousands of worldwide meteorologists and observers. Modernized computers make predictions more precise than ever, and earth-orbiting weather satellites capture pictures of clouds from space. However, in many cases, the forecast under many conditions is not accurate. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) is one of the popular methods for forecasting weather conditions. NWP is a major weather modeling tool for meteorologists which contributes to more accurate accuracy. In this research, the weather forecasting model uses the C5.0 algorithm with K-means clustering. The C5.0 is one of the better decision tree classifiers, and the decision tree is a great alternative for forecasting and prediction. The algorithm for clustering the K-means is used to combine identical data together. For this process, the clustering of K-means is initially applied to divide the dataset into the closest cluster of K. For training and testing, the meteorological data collection obtained from the database Modern-Era Historical Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) is used. The model's performance is assessed through MAE mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE).

In this way, it takes advantage of the atmosphere models while capturing spatial and temporal correlation between meteorological observations at different locations. Three machine learning algorithms (artificial neural network, support vector regression, Gaussian process) are proposed to synthesize the meteorological data and the prediction from NWP.

To a significant degree, prediction accuracy is determined by the data used in model initialization, assimilated from a variety of observational platforms. At present, the volume of weather data collected in a given day greatly exceeds the ability of assimilation systems to make use of it. Typically, data is ingested uniformly at the highest fixed resolution that enables the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to deliver its prediction in a timely fashion. In order to make more efficient use of newly available high-resolution data sources, we seek to identify regions of interest (ROI) where increased data quality or volume is likely to significantly enhance weather prediction accuracy. In particular, we wish to improve the utilization of data from the recently launched Geostationary Operation Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16, which provides orders of magnitude more data than its predecessors. To achieve this, we demonstrate a method for locating tropical cyclones using only observations of precipitable water, which is evaluated using the Global Forecast System (GFS) weather prediction model.

We cast the weather forecasting problem as an end-to-end deep learning problem and solve it by proposing a novel negative log-likelihood error (NLE) loss function. A notable advantage of our proposed method is that it simultaneously implements single-value forecasting and uncertainty quantification, which we refer to as deep uncertainty quantification (DUQ). Efficient deep ensemble strategies are also explored to further improve performance. This new approach was evaluated on a public dataset collected from weather stations in Beijing, China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NLE loss significantly improves generalization compared to mean squared error (MSE) loss and mean absolute error (MAE) loss.

This paper aims to combine data from a Numerical Weather Prediction model with machine learning tools in order to accurately predict the power generation from a photovoltaic system. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is used to predict power outputs from a real installation located in Puglia (southern Italy) using temperature and solar irradiation data taken from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) sflux model outputs. Power outputs and weather monitoring data from the PV installation are used as a reference dataset. Three training and testing scenarios are designed.

In the second one, training is done with monitoring data, but GDAS data is used to predict the results. In the last set, both training and result prediction are done by feeding GDAS weather data into the ANN model.

However, in many areas, it is economically and locally difficult to collect observation data by installing automatic weather stations (AWSs). We developed a Mini-AWS, much smaller than AWSs, to complement the shortcomings of AWSs. The installation and maintenance costs of Mini-AWSs are lower than those of AWSs; Mini-AWSs have fewer spatial constraints with respect to the installation than AWSs.

Yet, its production is characterized by high uncertainty, being dependent on weather conditions like solar irradiance and temperature. Predicting PV production, even in the 24-hour forecast, remains a challenge and leads energy providers to left idling - often carbon emitting - plants. In this paper, we introduce a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network using Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP) to predict, in turn, PV production in the 24-hour and 48-hour forecast horizons. This network architecture fully leverages both temporal and spatial weather data, sampled over the whole geographical area of interest.

Two main application areas of CSO are described: data assimilation and verification.

However, special care has to be taken about data protection and the quality of observations. In this paper, two examples are presented: the SMAPS experiment from Denmark and the uWx experiment from the United States. Another data assimilation topic is citizen observations with low-cost weather sensors; here an example from Norway is presented using Netatmo stations.

Importantly, one of the key needs for nowcasting systems is in the provision of accurate warnings of adverse weather events, such as heavy rain and flooding, for the protection of life and property in such situations. Typical nowcasting approaches are based on simple extrapolation models applied to observations, primarily rainfall radar. In this paper we review existing techniques to radar-based nowcasting from environmental sciences, as well as the statistical approaches that are applicable from the field of machine learning.

These events include heavy rain as an important hazard factor, which poses a serious threat to the public safety of coastal cities. Presently, numerical weather prediction (NWP) is an important and commonly used method to support the forecasting of the impact of TCs. However, relatively high uncertainty still remains in quantitative precipitation predictions provided by NWP, which makes it difficult to meet the demands of public safety management in regions affected by TCs. To remediate this deficiency, the study combines machine learning (ML) techniques with NWP and proposes a new analogue identification method for TC precipitation estimation. The method consists of three parts. First, the output data of historical NWPs, including wind, temperature, humidity of 850 hPa and sea-level pressure field, are deposited into a massive sample library. Second, the dimensionality of the sample library is reduced by using the locally linear embedding (LLE) method, and a characteristic subspace containing the features of the original sample library is formed. Finally, when a new NWP prediction appears, it can be projected into the characteristic subspace, and the historical NWP sample having the greatest similarity with the current NWP prediction can be identified. The observational precipitation corresponding to the most similar historical NWP sample can then be used to estimate the potential impact of current TCs. This method is verified using observation results from the coastal city of Shenzhen, China. The results show that the prediction of the method proposed in the current study exhibited significant improvement compared with prediction results provided by both the NWP's direct output and a traditional method used in the city.",2021,2021/10/6 12:33,2021/10/6 12:33,2021/10/6 12:33,e1978,,2,28,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/met.1978,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/7SZFNDJJ/Liu et al. - 2021 - Estimation of precipitation induced by tropical cy.pdf,,,machine learning; numerical weather prediction; analogue identification; Shenzhen; tropical cyclone precipitation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing.

Here, we use a 6-week data set of turbulence measurements from 184 sonic anemometers in complex terrain at the Perdigão field campaign to suggest improved representations of dissipation rate.

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are becoming more complex, with higher resolutions, and there are increasing numbers of different models in operation. While the forecasting skill of NWP models continues to improve, the number and complexity of these models poses a new challenge for the operational meteorologist: how should the information from all available models, each with their own unique biases and limitations, be combined in order to provide stakeholders with well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts to use in decision making? In this paper, we use a road surface temperature example to demonstrate a three-stage framework that uses machine learning to bridge the gap between sets of separate forecasts from NWP models and the ‘ideal’ forecast for decision support: probabilities of future weather outcomes. First, we use quantile regression forests to learn the error profile of each numerical model, and use these to apply empirically derived probability distributions to forecasts. Second, we combine these probabilistic forecasts using quantile averaging. Third, we interpolate between the aggregate quantiles in order to generate a full predictive distribution, which we demonstrate has properties suitable for decision support. Our results suggest that this approach provides an effective and operationally viable framework for the cohesive post-processing of weather forecasts across multiple models and lead times to produce a well-calibrated probabilistic output.

For example, the most highly-resolved numerical weather prediction models are limited to approximately 3 km. However many weather and climate impacts occur over much finer scales, especially in urban areas and regions with high topographic complexity like mountains or coastal regions. Thus several statistical methods have been developed in the climate community to downscale numerical model output to finer resolutions. This is conceptually similar to image super-resolution (SR) and in this work we report the results of applying SR methods to the downscaling problem. In particular we test the extent to which a SR method based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can recover a grid of wind speed from an artificially downsampled version, compared against a standard bicubic upsampling approach and another state-of-the-art machine learning based approach, SR-CNN. We use ESRGAN to learn to downscale wind speeds by a factor of 4 from a coarse grid. The bicubic and SR-CNN methods perform better thanESRGAN on coarse metrics such as MSE. However, the high frequency powerspectrum is captured remarkably well by the ESRGAN, virtually identical to the real data, while bicubic and SR-CNN fidelity drops significantly at high frequency. This indicates that SR is considerably better at matching the higher-order statistics of the dataset, consistent with the observation that the generated images are of superior visual quality compared with SR-CNN.",2019/12/1,2021/10/6 12:38,2021/10/6 12:38,2021/10/6 12:38,GC43D-1357,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2019AGUFMGC43D1357W,,,,,machine learning; 0555 Neural networks; 1626 Global climate models; 1942 Machine learning; 4313 Extreme events; COMPUTATIONAL GEOPHYSICS; fuzzy logic; GLOBAL CHANGE; INFORMATICS; NATURAL HAZARDS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper aims to combine data from a Numerical Weather Prediction model with machine learning tools in order to accurately predict the power generation from a photovoltaic system. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is used to predict power outputs from a real installation located in Puglia (southern Italy) using temperature and solar irradiation data taken from the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) sflux model outputs. Power outputs and weather monitoring data from the PV installation are used as a reference dataset. Three training and testing scenarios are designed. In the first one, weather data monitoring is used to both train the ANN model and predict power outputs. In the second one, training is done with monitoring data, but GDAS data is used to predict the results. In the last set, both training and result prediction are done by feeding GDAS weather data into the ANN model.

Predictors come from nearly 11 years of reforecasts from NOAA’s Second-Generation Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast (GEFS/R) model and derive from a variety of thermodynamic and kinematic variables that characterize the meteorological regime in addition to the quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) output from the ensemble.

Distinct models are trained for eight different hydrometeorologically cohesive regions of the CONUS. One algorithm supplies the GEFS/R predictors directly to a random forest (RF) procedure to produce extreme precipitation forecasts; the second also employs RFs, but the predictors instead undergo principal component analysis (PCA), and extracted leading components are supplied to the RF. In the last algorithm, dimension-reduced predictors are supplied to a logistic regression (LR) algorithm instead of an RF.

Each horizontal grid in the integration domain of the NWP model is characterized by a feature vector, which consists of a multivariable with multiple pressure levels. All horizontal grids at every forecast time are classified based on the GMM clustering. The classification results show that grids are clustered into air masses or disturbances with the same meteorological characteristics. This paper describes application of the proposed classification method as a framework to verify the forecast of surface solar irradiance from the NWP model. Satellite observation data are used as the reference so that verification can be performed over the integration domain of the NWP model for each air mass or disturbance that moves and changes shape over time. The mean square error (MSE) is decomposed into the square of the mean error and the MSE between variables centered on zero, the square root of which is called the centered root mean square error (CRMSE). The analyses are performed for forecast data over a 2 day forecast horizon. The change in mean error is not significant until the second day, whereas the CRMSE is maintained only during the first day. Each air mass has a different forecast error structure.

Here, we train a deep residual convolutional neural network (Resnet) to predict geopotential, temperature and precipitation at 5.625° resolution up to 5 days ahead. To avoid overfitting and improve forecast skill, we pretrain the model using historical climate model output before fine-tuning on reanalysis data. The resulting forecasts outperform previous submissions to WeatherBench and are comparable in skill to a physical baseline at similar resolution.

While power-grid operators have to keep the production equal to demand, wind power depends on meteorological conditions. Therefore, the main issue of power-grid operators is to predict the wind production as precisely as possible. Our goal is to improve wind prediction accuracy based on the feedback of the relevant work on the subject. To this purpose, past power production and Numerical Weather Predictions (NWP) are used as input of a Gradient Boosting Tree algorithm. Our approach is to lay emphasis on the input data in order to extract as much knowledge as possible and remove as much error as possible from the source. Therefore, 20 days have been removed and additional values have been calculated to improve the algorithm accuracy. The novelty of our approach is in the constant retraining of the model to give the latest information available contrary to most studies, which use a fixed learning dataset. The idea is to combine the advantage of regression models and machine learning algorithms, which use large datasets, in order to learn the relationship between wind production, NWP, and date and time information. The whole methodology helps the model anticipate error of wind prediction and seasonal trends so that the overall prediction accuracy increases by 17% compared to the persistance approach. Using 9 months of historical values from 2016.12 to 2017.08 and predicting from 2017.09 to 2018.01, a prediction accuracy of 83% has been achieved; 17% better than the persistence model. Result analysis show that more improvement can be achieved with a focus on low wind speed values, an improvement of weather prediction using real local weather measures and a reduction of the forecast horizon. The whole prediction process have been automatized and a visualization web page have been implemented.",5月-18,2021/10/6 12:40,2021/10/6 12:40,,43-48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,,,,,,Predictive models; Wind forecasting; Wind power generation; Production,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2018 International Workshop on Big Data and Information Security (IWBIS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data. The underestimated SIC from the BT and ASI algorithms for high SIC regions might be compensated by the atmospheric water vapor content. The differences in SIC values estimated from each algorithm were due to different sensitivities to atmospheric water vapor content in the regions with KOMPSAT-5 SIC lower than 40% and to ice surface melting in the regions with higher KOMPSAT-5 SIC.",2018/5/1,2021/10/6 12:41,2021/10/6 12:41,2021/10/6 12:41,343-362,,,209,,Remote Sensing of Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Numerical weather prediction; Chukchi Sea; KOMPSAT-5; Passive microwave sensor; Sea ice algorithm; Sea ice concentration; Synthetic aperture radar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, the capacity is calculated for the worst-case thermal conditions and is then set as a static limit. While this approach is easy to implement, capacity is wasted because the worst-case conditions occur infrequently. Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) is a technology developed to overcome this problem by changing the rating in real-time in response to the current environmental conditions. This approach is effective and allows for full utilization of the capacity of the conductor. However, extensive monitoring equipment, communication infrastructure and support in the management system of the operator is required. This paper presents an alternative approach, where the rating is set daily based on a Numerical Weather Prediction generated the previous day. This method is similar to a seasonal rating, also known as Quasi or Semi-Dynamic line rating, but differs in that it uses a very short time frame of one day, as opposed to a month or a quarter year. A statistical model is used to quantify the uncertainty in prediction to assure the reliability of the predicted ampacity.

In particular, rapidly ascending air streams in extratropical cyclones, so-called warm conveyor belts (WCBs), modulate the upper-tropospheric Rossby wave pattern and are sources and magnifiers of forecast uncertainty. Thus, from a process-oriented perspective, numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models should adequately represent WCBs. The identification of WCBs usually involves Lagrangian air parcel trajectories that ascend from the lower to the upper troposphere within two days. This requires numerical data with high spatial and temporal resolution which is often not available from standard output and requires expensive computations. This study introduces a novel framework that aims to predict the footprints of the WCB inflow, ascent, and outflow stages over the Northern Hemisphere from instantaneous gridded fields using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). With its comparably low computational costs and relying on standard model output alone the new diagnostic enables the systematic investigation of WCBs in large data sets such as ensemble reforecast or climate model projections which are mostly not suited for trajectory calculations. Building on the insights from a logistic regression approach of a previous study, the CNNs are trained using a combination of meteorological parameters as predictors and trajectory-based WCB footprints as predictands. Validation of the networks against the trajectory-based data set confirms that the CNN models reliably replicate the climatological frequency of WCBs as well as their footprints at instantaneous time steps. The CNN models significantly outperform previously developed logistic regression models. Including time-lagged information on the occurrence of WCB ascent as a predictor for the inflow and outflow stages further improves the models' skill considerably. A companion study demonstrates versatile applications of the CNNs in different data sets including the verification of WCBs in ensemble forecasts. Overall, the diagnostic demonstrates how deep learning methods may be used to investigate the representation of weather systems and of their related processes in NWP and climate models in order to shed light on forecast uncertainty and systematic biases from a process-oriented perspective.</p>",2021/9/22,2021/10/6 12:44,2021/10/6 12:44,2021/10/6 12:44,29-1月,,,,,,EuLerian Identification of ascending Air Streams (ELIAS 2.0) in Numerical Weather Prediction and Climate Models.

Therefore, for many applications forecasts are only considered valuable if an uncertainty estimate can be assigned to them. Currently, the best method to provide a confidence estimate for individual forecasts is to produce an ensemble of numerical weather simulations, which is computationally very expensive. Here, we assess whether machine learning techniques can provide an alternative approach to predict the uncertainty of a weather forecast given the large-scale atmospheric state at initialization. We propose a method based on deep learning with artificial convolutional neural networks that is trained on past weather forecasts. Given a new weather situation, it assigns a scalar value of confidence to medium-range forecasts initialized from the said atmospheric state, indicating whether the predictability is higher or lower than usual for the time of the year. While our method has a lower skill than ensemble weather forecast models in predicting forecast uncertainty, it is computationally very efficient and outperforms a range of alternative methods that do not involve performing numerical forecasts. This shows that it is possible to use machine learning in order to estimate future forecast uncertainty from past forecasts.

Passive microwave (PM) sensors such as AMSR2 have observed sea ice in polar region and provided SIC every day since 1970s. However, the SIC from the PM observations is typically inaccurate in Arctic summer due to similar microwave radiation characteristics of sea ice and open water, which is mainly attributed to the atmospheric effects. Inclusion of information of atmospheric effects into PM observations can improve the accuracy of SIC estimation in summer. In this study, summer SIC estimation model for the Chukchi Sea in Arctic Ocean based on machine learning approach is developed by using AMSR2 brightness temperatures, ERA-Interim reanalysis data and KOMPSAT-5 SAR images. The brightness temperatures measured by AMSR2 and atmospheric effects predicted by the ERA-Interim are used as input variables for the SIC estimation.

In a data assimilation framework, recent advances in the context of weak-constraint 4D-Var have shown that it is possible to estimate and correct for a large fraction of systematic model error which develops in the stratosphere over short forecast ranges. The recent explosion of interest in machine learning/deep learning technologies has been driven by their remarkable success in disparate application areas. This raises the question of whether model error estimation and correction in operational NWP and climate prediction can also benefit from these techniques. In this work, we aim to start to give an answer to this question. Specifically, we show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can reproduce the main results obtained with weak-constraint 4D-Var in the operational configuration of the IFS model of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). We show that the use of ANN models inside the weak-constraint 4D-Var framework has the potential to extend the applicability of the weak-constraint methodology for model error correction to the whole atmospheric column. Finally, we discuss the potential and limitations of the machine learning/deep learning technologies in the core NWP tasks.

The workshop brought together experts from a variety of backgrounds to survey the status of the uptake of machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) methodologies in the ESOP communities, evaluate their expected impacts and build a consensus view on the best way to realize the untapped potential of ML/DL in Earth system science. Machine and deep learning techniques have made possible remarkable advances in an ever-growing number of disparate application areas, e.g., natural language processing, computer vision, autonomous vehicles, health care, and finance. These advances have been driven by the huge increase in available data and computing power as well as the emergence of more effective and efficient algorithms to extract relevant information from these data pools. Earth system sciences have benefited greatly from well-known laws governing system behavior, such as the Navier–Stokes equations for fluid flow or the laws governing radiative transfer, and the success of the field has in many ways been based on its ability to translate these physical/dynamical laws into accurate numerical models. However, the field is expanding into areas that, due to the scales involved, are not easy to model from fundamental principles—this includes areas such as cloud and precipitation physics and biological processes; further, there are areas where system parameters are heterogeneous on fine scales and hence are not fully known—e.g., Earth’s surface, its vegetation, soil, and hydrological properties. Earth system sciences have arguably been latecomers to the ML/DL party, but interest is rapidly growing, as borne out by the increasing number of publications in the field which make use of ML/DL techniques and confirmed by the large number of participants to this workshop and to other similar events. Innovative applications of ML/DL tools are becoming increasingly common and the workshop was structured to reflect their increasing relevance for all aspects of the numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate prediction workflow (Fig. 1).

Here I want to focus on how NWP can better help save lives from increasingly extreme weather in those parts of the world where society is most vulnerable. Whilst we can rightly be proud of many parts of our NWP heritage, its evolution has been influenced by national or institutional politics as well as by underpinning scientific principles.

Multiple operational models and ensembles currently predict hail, however ML models are more computationally efficient and do not require the physical assumptions associated with explicit predictions. Calibrating the ML-based predictions toward familiar forecaster output allows for a combination of higher skill associated with ML models and increased forecaster trust in the output. The observational dataset used to train and verify the random forest model is the Maximum Estimated Size of Hail (MESH), a Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) product. To build trust in the predictions, the ML-based hail predictions are calibrated using isotonic regression. The target datasets for isotonic regression include the local storm reports and Storm Prediction Center (SPC) practically perfect data. Verification of the ML predictions indicates that the probability magnitudes output from the calibrated models closely resemble the day-1 SPC outlook and practically perfect data. The ML model calibrated toward the local storm reports exhibited better or similar skill to the uncalibrated predictions, while decreasing model bias. Increases in reliability and skill after calibration may increase forecaster trust in the automated hail predictions.</p></section>",2020/2/1,2021/10/6 12:52,2021/10/6 12:52,2021/10/6 12:52,149-168,,1,35,,,,,,,,,,EN,,,,,journals.ametsoc.org,,Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Weather and Forecasting,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/XQWFKY7T/Burke et al. - 2020 - Calibration of Machine Learning–Based Probabilisti.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As this assumption does not hold at fine horizontal resolutions, improved ways to represent turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) dissipation rate (ϵ) are needed. Here, we use a 6-week data set of turbulence measurements from 184 sonic anemometers in complex terrain at the Perdigão field campaign to suggest improved representations of dissipation rate. First, we demonstrate that the widely used Mellor, Yamada, Nakanishi, and Niino (MYNN) parameterization of TKE dissipation rate leads to a large inaccuracy and bias in the representation of ϵ. Next, we assess the potential of machine-learning techniques to predict TKE dissipation rate from a set of atmospheric and terrain-related features. We train and test several machine-learning algorithms using the data at Perdigão, and we find that the models eliminate the bias MYNN currently shows in representing ϵ, while also reducing the average error by up to almost 40 %. Of all the variables included in the algorithms, TKE is the variable responsible for most of the variability of ϵ, and a strong positive correlation exists between the two.

Compared to time series analysis, stochastic models and machine learning techniques, numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have unbeatable competitive advantages in day-ahead forecasting of solar radiation because it manipulates vast datasets from satellites, radiosondes and surface-based observing systems, and performs comprehensive computations based on fundamental physics and chemistry. NWP models are often limited in temporal resolution due to the large computational cost over a wide range of space-time scales and challenges in simulating multiple physical processes in small scales. This study introduces a hybrid model that combines NWP models and a stochastic downscaling technique to produce high temporal frequency forecasts of solar radiation, in hour-ahead and day-ahead time horizons. This hybrid model is evaluated using 2-year surface-based observations by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Solar Radiation Research Laboratory (SRRL).

Meteorology, long based on extrapolating patterns in space and time, gave way to computational methods in a decade of advances in numerical weather forecasting. Those same methods also gave rise to computational climate science, studying the behaviour of those same numerical equations over intervals much longer than weather events, and changes in external boundary conditions. Several subsequent decades of exponential growth in computational power have brought us to the present day, where models ever grow in resolution and complexity, capable of mastery of many small-scale phenomena with global repercussions, and ever more intricate feedbacks in the Earth system. The current juncture in computing, seven decades later, heralds an end to what is called Dennard scaling, the physics behind ever smaller computational units and ever faster arithmetic. This is prompting a fundamental change in our approach to the simulation of weather and climate, potentially as revolutionary as that wrought by John von Neumann in the 1950s. One approach could return us to an earlier era of pattern recognition and extrapolation, this time aided by computational power. Another approach could lead us to insights that continue to be expressed in mathematical equations. In either approach, or any synthesis of those, it is clearly no longer the steady march of the last few decades, continuing to add detail to ever more elaborate models.

Long term forecast of solar power generation is produced by the numerical weather prediction and photovoltaic (PV) transformation model that yields the conversion of solar irradiance into electric power at a specific PV configuration. Short term forecast highly depends on the in situ measurement of solar irradiance or PV power itself with time series model or machine learning technic. To fill the gap between short (15 minutes ahead) and long term (same day or day ahead) forecast, cloud moving vector which is derived by two consecutive satellite imagery forecasts the solar irradiance. In this study, ground observed solar irradiance employs to derive the time series model for 15 minutes ahead forecast of solar irradiance. The reason why the we do not use the PV power data itself is because this data might be cut off to keep excessive electricity into energy storage system. Cloud moving vector is derived by the solar irradiance map that is produced by the UASIBS-KIER model with Chollian satellite over the Korean Peninsula. Unified Model Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (UM-LDAPS) and Global Forecast System (GFS) models initialized at 00 and 18 UTC every day from January 1 to December 31, 2018 are used to predict the hourly and daily mean solar irradiance at four ground observing stations in Korea. As a reference model, persistent model is employed to compare the modeling performance at various forecast horizon. For the same day forecast, relative root mean square error of hourly instantaneous solar irradiance from GFS model is averaged as being 19.2% in Korea.

During weather consultation, the forecasters obtain the final results by combining the observations with the NWP results and giving opinions based on their experience. It is obvious that using a suitable post-processing algorithm for simulating weather consultation is an interesting and important topic. MOML is a post-processing method based on machine learning, which matches NWP forecasts against observations through a regression function. By adopting different feature engineering of datasets and training periods, the observational and model data can be processed into the corresponding training set and test set. The MOML regression function uses an existing machine learning algorithm with the processed dataset to revise the output of NWP models combined with the observations, so as to improve the results of weather forecasts. To test the new approach for grid temperature forecasts, the 2-m surface air temperature in the Beijing area from the ECMWF model is used. MOML with different feature engineering is compared against the ECMWF model and modified model output statistics (MOS) method. MOML shows a better numerical performance than the ECMWF model and MOS, especially for winter. The results of MOML with a linear algorithm, running training period, and dataset using spatial interpolation ideas, are better than others when the forecast time is within a few days. The results of MOML with the Random Forest algorithm, year-round training period, and dataset containing surrounding gridpoint information, are better when the forecast time is longer.",,2021/10/6 12:56,2021/10/6 12:56,2021/10/6 12:56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/E6DUTBUB/s00376-019-9023-z.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that a specific type of deep neural networks can learn rainfall extremes from a numerical weather prediction ensemble. A frequency-based weighting of the loss function is proposed to enable the learning of extreme values in the distributions’ tails.

These ongoing improvements are due to advances in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and the advent of ever more powerful supercomputers that allow simulating future weather and its uncertainty with increasing resolution and using ensemble approaches. Such physics-based computer models, however, are not free of systematic errors. Statistical postprocessing can be used to calibrate NWP forecasts to further improve forecast quality and better exploit the available information. Here we present results from several explorative deep learning studies using artificial neural networks (ANN) to calibrate high resolution forecasts of temperature, precipitation, wind, and cloud cover in Switzerland. These first attempts at ANN-based postprocessing help us to understand the strengths and weaknesses of machine learning and are the basis to build more complex and comprehensive statistical models accounting for local effects in complex terrain such as the Swiss Alps. In all cases, ANN leads to significant improvements over the direct NWP output. While the improvement is comparable in magnitude with improvements achieved with conventional postprocessing approaches, ANN-based postprocessing is easier to generalize in space for a calibration of forecasts also at unobserved sites. In addition to the results of the postprocessing, we will also discuss the lessons learned so far in using machine learning for this particular problem.",2020/5/1,2021/10/6 12:57,2021/10/6 12:57,2021/10/6 12:57,11422,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020EGUGA..2211422B,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We integrate dynamical modeling with machine learning to demonstrate the enhanced quality of streamflow forecasts at short-to medium-range timescales (1 - 7 days). Dynamical modeling generates ensemble streamflow forecasts by forcing a hydrological model with numerical weather prediction model outputs. We employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to correct forecast biases in raw ensemble streamflow forecasts obtained from dynamical modeling. For forecast verification, we use different metrics such as skill score and reliability diagram conditioned upon the lead time, flow threshold, and season. The verification results show that the LSTM can improve streamflow forecasts relative to climatological, temporal persistence, deterministic, and raw ensemble forecasts. The LSTM demonstrates improvement across all lead times, flow thresholds, and seasons. As compared to the raw ensembles, relative gain in forecast skill from LSTM is generally higher at medium-range timescales compared to initial lead time; high flows compared to low-moderate flows; and warm-season compared to the cool ones.

The model is trained using ECMWF ReAnalysis 5 (ERA5) data and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on a cubed-sphere grid. Our ensemble includes perturbations to both initial-conditions and model-physics. The initial-condition perturbations are drawn from the set of 10 perturbed ERA5 members and do not produce optimum initial spread. Stochastic model-physics perturbations are produced by randomizing the training process for the CNNs. Our 320-member grand ensemble consists of each of 32 slightly different CNNs run from each of the 10 initial conditions. At lead times up to two weeks, our DLWP ensemble lags the state-of-the-art 50-member ECMWF numerical weather prediction (NWP) ensemble by 2-3 days of forecast lead time. Despite the non-optimal set of initial conditions, our ensemble is just slightly under-dispersive. Extending forecasts to the sub-seasonal forecast range of 2-6 weeks, a particularly challenging forecasting window, our DLWP ensemble consistently outperforms persistence forecasts of 850-hPa temperature (T850) and 2-m temperature, with skill relative to climatology as measured by the ranked probability skill score (RPSS) and the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). Evaluating performance for twice-weekly forecasts over the period 2017-18, our CRPS matches that of the ECMWF ensemble to within 95% confidence bounds for T850 at week 4 and weeks 5-6. Our ensemble system, which predicts six 2D shells of atmospheric data at approximately 1.4 x1.4-degree-spatial and 6-hour-temporal resolution has a huge computational speed advantage over traditional NWP models; a 6-week forecast with 320 ensemble members runs in about half a second on a single graphics processing unit. There are many potential improvements to our relatively simple DLWP ensemble system that might be expected to both yield better forecasts and require more computational effort. It remains to be seen how well models from the rapidly developing field of machine-learning-based weather forecasting will ultimately compare to the much more mature products generated with conventional NWP, but these early results are encouraging.",2020/12/1,2021/10/6 12:58,2021/10/6 12:58,2021/10/6 12:58,A073-03,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020AGUFMA073...03D,,,,,1942 Machine learning; INFORMATICS; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES; 3333 Model calibration; 3337 Global climate models; 3339 Ocean/atmosphere interactions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study clarifies whether certain potential factors related to model training can influence the predictive skill of the random forest method. The results indicate that enforcing a balanced prediction by resampling the training datasets or lowering the threshold probability for classification cannot improve the predictive skill of the random forest model. The study reveals that the predictive skill of the random forest model shows seasonality, but is only weakly influenced by the geographic diversity of the training dataset. Finally, the study shows that the most important predictor is the precipitation predictions by the radar nowcasts followed by the precipitation predictions by the numerical weather predictions.

P2X7PA4Q,webpage,,,Downscaling numerical weather models with conditional generative adversarial networks. (Journal Article) | DOE PAGES,,,,,https://par.nsf.gov/biblio/10137368,"Abstract—Numerical simulation of weather is resolution-constrained due to the high computational cost of integrating the coupled PDEs that govern atmospheric motion. For example, the most highly-resolved numerical weather prediction models are limited to approximately 3 km. However many weather and climate impacts occur over much finer scales, especially in urban areas and regions with high topographic complexity like mountains or coastal regions. Thus several statistical methods have been developed in the climate community to downscale numerical model output to finer resolutions. This is conceptually similar to image super-resolution (SR) [1] and in this work we report the results of applying SR methods to the downscaling problem. In particular we test the extent to which a SR method based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can recover a grid of wind speed from an artificially downsampled version, compared against a standard bicubic upsampling approach and another machine learning based approach, SR-CNN [1]. We use ESRGAN ([2]) to learn to downscale wind speeds by a factor of 4 from a coarse grid. We find that we can recover spatial details with higher fidelity than bicubic upsampling or SR-CNN. The bicubic and SR-CNN methods perform better than ESRGAN on coarse metrics such as MSE. However, the high frequency power spectrum is captured remarkably well by the ESRGAN, virtually identical to the real data, while bicubic and SR-CNN fidelity drops significantly at high frequency. This indicates that SR is considerably better at matching the higher-order statistics of the dataset, consistent with the observation that the generated images are of superior visual quality compared with SR-CNN. « less",,2021/10/6 13:32,2021/10/6 13:33,2021/10/6 13:32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/TRHHLRW4/10137368.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method is based on recurrent neural networks and allows for ensemble forecasts to quantify uncertainties.

We also developed two precipitation nowcasting systems with the every-30-second PAWR data: one with an optical-flow-based system, the other with a deep-learning-based system. We chose the convolutional Long Short Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) as a deep learning algorithm, and found it effective for precipitation nowcasting. The results show that the Conv-LSTM-based nowcasting outperforms the optical-flow-based nowcasting. The Conv-LSTM takes inputs from most recent PAWR data and produces future data as the prediction. For further improvement, the Conv-LSTM is designed to take inputs from future data. Here, we use prediction data from 30-second-update NWP. The Conv-LSTM system taking inputs from both past PAWR data and NWP forecast data can be considered as a step toward the integration of DA and AI with HPC.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm event database was used to generate a list of tornadoes from the years 2006 to the present. Using the space and time location of the events, atmospheric reanalysis data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) was used to generate a large training set of one-hour time averaged variables, such as wind speed, temperature, humidity, and other variables at multiple levels in the atmosphere at the time and location of the tornado.

In the last decades, machine learning models have been developed to tackle different issues in society, but there is still a gap in applications to applied physics. Here, different machine learning models are evaluated for precipitation prediction over South America. Currently, numerical weather prediction models are unable to precisely reproduce the precipitation patterns in South America due to many factors such as the lack of region-specific parametrizations and data availability. The results are compared to the general circulation atmospheric model currently used operationally in the National Institute for Space Research (INPE: Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais), Brazil. Machine learning models are able to produce predictions with errors under 2 mm in most of the continent in comparison to satellite-observed precipitation patterns for different climate seasons, and also outperform INPE’s model for some regions (e.g., reduction of errors from 8 to 2 mm in central South America in winter). Another advantage is the computational performance from machine learning models, running faster with much lower computer resources than models based on differential equations currently used in operational centers.

Limited by data availability of the numerical weather prediction (NWP), the public weather forecasting (PWF) has been widely used to forecast daily ET0 in China. Recently, two Chinese independently developed NWP products have been open to the public, namely, the Global/Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES) and the T639 Global Medium-term Numerical Forecast Model (T639L60). In this paper, the forecast of ET0 is evaluated based on the recently released NWP outputs and the PWF using the FAO-56 PM equation. The daily ET0 forecast of the two datasets was compared against the ET0 that was calculated using weather variables observed from 31 automatic weather stations across a wide range of climate zones in China, including the temperate continental zone (TC), temperate monsoon zone (TM), mountain plateau zone (MP) and subtropical monsoon zone (SM). The results showed that the forecast performance of NWP for maximum and minimum air temperature (Tmax, Tmin) was worse due to the large errors in the altitude estimation process. The forecast performance of NWP for net radiation (Rnet) forecasted was better than that of PWF in the MP, TC and TM, while slightly worse in the SM. The VPD from the NWP was more accurate in TC and TM, while showed little difference with that from PWF in MP and SM. For the wind speed (u2), the NWP showed better forecast accuracy than PWF in all climate zones. Furthermore, the better forecast performance of ET0 was obtained by the NWP in the MP and TC. In the TM and SM, the PWF can provide a more accurate ET0 forecast compared to the NWP. Overall, the NWP can serve as a promising data source to generate acceptable ET0 forecasts across China. The high spatial resolution of the NWP provides the ability to capture the high resolution of the spatial variability in ET0, especially in the MP and TC where weather stations are sparse.",2020/11/1,2021/10/6 13:39,2021/10/6 13:39,2021/10/6 13:39,125547,,,590,,Journal of Hydrology,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Numerical weather prediction; Reference evapotranspiration; Net radiation; Public weather forecast,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the utilization of wind energy remains challenging due to its strong stochastic nature. Accurate wind power forecasting is one of the effective ways to address this problem. Meteorological data are generally regarded as critical inputs for wind power forecasting. However, the direct use of numerical weather prediction in forecasting may not provide a high degree of accuracy due to unavoidable uncertainties, particularly for areas with complex topography. This study proposes a hybrid short-term wind power forecasting method, which integrates the corrected numerical weather prediction and spatial correlation into a Gaussian process. First, the Gaussian process model is built using the optimal combination of different kernel functions. Then, a correction model for the wind speed is designed by using an automatic relevance determination algorithm to correct the errors in the primary numerical weather prediction. Moreover, the spatial correlation of wind speed series between neighbouring wind farms is extracted to complement the input data. Finally, the modified numerical weather prediction and spatial correlation are incorporated into the hybrid model to enable reliable forecasting. The actual data in East China are used to demonstrate its performance. In comparison with the basic Gaussian process, in different seasons, the forecasting accuracy is improved by 7.02%–29.7% by using additional corrected numerical weather prediction, by 0.65–10.23% after integrating with the spatial correlation, and by 10.88–37.49% through using the proposed hybrid method.",2021/7/1,2021/10/6 13:40,2021/10/6 13:40,2021/10/6 13:40,116951,,,293,,Applied Energy,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Numerical weather prediction; Gaussian process; Hybrid model; Kernel function; Spatial correlation; Wind power forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While GOES observations are used extensively by human forecasters for situational awareness, there has been limited usage of GOES imager data in numerical weather prediction (NWP), and operational data assimilation (DA) has ignored cloud and precipitating pixels. The motivation of this project is to bring the benefits of GOES-R Series enhanced capabilities to advance convective-scale DA for improving convective-scale forecasts. We have developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) prototype, dubbed ""GOES Radar Estimation via Machine Learning to Inform NWP (GREMLIN)"" that fuses GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) information to produce maps of synthetic composite radar reflectivity. We find that the ability of CNNs to utilize spatial context is essential for this application and offers breakthrough improvement in skill compared to traditional pixel-by-pixel based approaches. Making use of ABI spatial information potentially provides benefits over radiance assimilation approaches that are limited by saturation of radiances in pixels with precipitation. This presentation will briefly describe the GREMLIN model and characterize its performance across meteorological regimes. We are developing a dense neural network (DNN) to produce vertical profiles of radar reflectivity and latent heating based on the two-dimensional fields output from GREMLIN. The resulting three-dimensional fields of latent heating will be used to initialize NWP simulations of convective-scale phenomena. Another DNN will be developed to produce uncertainty estimates of latent heating for each pixel. Our approach for data assimilation will be described and is innovative in being the first-time machine learning (ML) will be used for the nonlinear latent heating observation operator in the NOAA hybrid Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) and/or JEDI systems.

Moreover, WCBs modulate the large-scale extratropical circulation and can communicate and amplify forecast errors. Therefore, it is desirable to assess the representation of WCBs in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in particular on the medium to subseasonal forecast range. Most often, WCBs are identified as coherent bundles of Lagrangian trajectories that ascend in a time interval of 2 days from the lower to the upper troposphere. Although this Lagrangian approach has advanced the understanding of the involved processes significantly, the calculation of trajectories is computationally expensive and requires NWP data at a high spatial [<inline-formula xmlns:ifp=""http://www.ifactory.com/press""><math><mrow><mi mathvariant=""script"">O</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>~</mo><msup><mn>1</mn><mo>∘</mo></msup></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></inline-formula>], vertical [<inline-formula xmlns:ifp=""http://www.ifactory.com/press""><math><mrow><mi mathvariant=""script"">O</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>~</mo><mn>10</mn><mtext> </mtext><mtext>hPa</mtext></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></inline-formula>], and temporal resolution [<inline-formula xmlns:ifp=""http://www.ifactory.com/press""><math><mrow><mi mathvariant=""script"">O</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo><mrow><mo>~</mo><mn>3</mn><mtext>–</mtext><mn>6</mn><mtext> </mtext><mtext>h</mtext></mrow><mo>)</mo></mrow></mrow></math></inline-formula>]. In this study, we present a statistical framework that derives footprints of WCBs from coarser NWP data that are routinely available. To this end, gridpoint-specific multivariate logistic regression models are developed for the Northern Hemisphere using meteorological parameters from ERA-Interim data as predictors and binary footprints of WCB inflow, ascent, and outflow based on a Lagrangian dataset as predictands. Stepwise forward selection identifies the most important predictors for these three WCB stages. The logistic models are reliable in replicating the climatological frequency of WCBs as well as the footprints of WCBs at instantaneous time steps. The novel framework is a first step toward a systematic evaluation of WCB representation in large datasets such as subseasonal ensemble reforecasts or climate projections.</p></section>",2021/5/1,2021/10/6 13:41,2021/10/6 13:41,2021/10/6 13:41,1465-1485,,5,78,,,Toward a Systematic Evaluation of Warm Conveyor Belts in Numerical Weather Prediction and Climate Models.

The land-cover classification map used in the HARMONIE-AROME configuration of the shared ALADIN-HIRLAM NWP system for operational weather forecasting is ECOCLIMAP. ECOCLIMAP-SG (ECO-SG), the latest version of ECOCLIMAP, was evaluated over Ireland to prepare ECO-SG implementation in HARMONIE-AROME. This evaluation suggested that sparse urban areas are underestimated and instead appear as vegetation areas in ECO-SG [1], with an over-classification of grassland in place of sparse urban areas and other vegetation covers (Met Éireann internal communication). Some limitations in the performance of the current HARMONIE-AROME configuration attributed to surface processes and physiography issues are well-known [2]. This motivated work at Met Éireann to evaluate solutions to improve the land-cover map in HARMONIE-AROME. In terms of accuracy, resolution, and the future production of time-varying land-cover map, the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to create a land-cover map using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery [3] over Estonia [4] presented better potential outcomes than the use of local datasets [5]. Consequently, this method was tested over Ireland and proven to be more accurate than ECO-SG for representing CORINE Primary and Secondary labels and at a higher resolution [5]. This work is a continuity of [5] focusing on 1. increasing the number of labels, 2. optimising the training procedure, 3. expanding the method for application to other HIRLAM countries and 4. implementation of the new land-cover map in HARMONIE-AROME.",2021/6/18,2021/10/6 13:57,2021/10/6 13:57,2021/10/6 13:57,,,,,,,,,,,,Copernicus Meetings,,en,,,,,meetingorganizer.copernicus.org,,Conference Name: EMS2021 DOI: 10.5194/ems2021-53,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/QFK74KJX/Bessardon et al. - 2021 - Using machine learning to produce a very high-reso.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EMS2021-53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
CI6BCKET,journalArticle,2020,"Sobash, R.; Schwartz, C. S.; Ahijevych, D.; Gagne, D. J., II",Using machine learning to advance next-day probabilistic convective hazard prediction with convection-permitting models.,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMA196...05S,"Direct prediction of convective hazards using atmospheric models is difficult due to their small spatial scale. While convection-permitting (CP) numerical weather prediction forecasts can partially resolve convective structures, convective hazards (e.g., tornadoes or hail storms) are typically unresolved with horizontal grid-spacings >= 1 km. Using CP model guidance to provide hazard predictions thus relies on inferring hazard likelihood via surrogate diagnostics, such as updraft speed or updraft helicity (UH). Further, CP models often err in the placement, initiation, and intensity of convective storms, requiring the use of probabilities to convey forecast uncertainty of convective hazards. Here, we report on efforts to improve probabilistic predictions of hazards by combining surrogate diagnostics and environmental information within a machine learning framework for 1-2 day hazard prediction. Specifically, a feedforward neural network (NN) was used to produce gridded probabilistic convective hazard predictions over the contiguous United States. Input fields to the NN included 174 predictors, derived from 38 environmental and surrogate fields output by ~500 deterministic CP model forecasts, with observed severe storm reports used for training and verification. To evaluate the skill of the NNs, NN probability forecasts (NNPFs) were compared to surrogate-severe probability forecasts (SSPFs), generated by smoothing a field of surrogate reports derived with UH. NNPFs and SSPFs were produced each forecast hour on an 80-km grid, with forecasts valid for the occurrence of any severe weather report within 40 or 120 km, and 2 h, of each 80-km grid box. In aggregate, NNPFs were superior to SSPFs, producing statistically significant improvements in forecast reliability and resolution. NNPFs were most skillful relative to SSPFs when predicting hazards on larger-scales (e.g., 120 km vs. 40 km) and in situations where using UH was detrimental to forecast skill. These included model spin-up, nocturnal periods, and regions and environments where supercells were less common, such as the western and eastern United States and high-shear, low-CAPE regimes. Comparing ML hazard predictions to a non-ML baseline is an important step toward understanding ML forecast behavior and putting their skill in context.",2020/12/1,2021/10/6 13:57,2021/10/6 13:57,2021/10/6 13:57,A196-05,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020AGUFMA196...05S,,,,,4313 Extreme events; NATURAL HAZARDS; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES; 3355 Regional modeling; 1817 Extreme events; 3314 Convective processes; HYDROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The need for such predictions and their uncertainty is manifold: to estimate the load on the power grid, to take measures in case of too much/not enough renewable energy with reduced nuclear energy availability, rescheduling/adjusting of energy production, maintenance, trading, and more. Furthermore, TSOs and energy providers need the information as finegrained, spatially and temporarily, as possible, on third level hub or even on solar farm / wind turbine level for a comparatively large area.These needs pose a challenge to numerical weather prediction (NWP) post-processing methods. Typically, one uses selected NWP fields aswell as observations, if available, as input in post-processing methods. Here, we combine two post-processing methods namely a neural network and random forest approach with the Flex_extract algorithm. Flex_extract is the pre-processing algorithm for the langrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART and the trajectory model FLEXTRA. Flex_extract uses the three-dimensional wind fields of the NWP model and calculates additionally the instantaneous surfaces fluxes. Thus, coupling Flex_extract with a machine learning post-processing algorithm enables the usage of native NWP fields with a higher vertical accuracy than pressure levels. To generate an ensmeble in post-processing from deterministic sources different tools are available. Here, we will apply the Schaake Shuffle. In this study a neural network and random forest approach for probabilistic forecasting with a high horizontal grid resolution (1 km ) as well as a high temporal forecasting frequency of wind speed and global horizontal irradiance for Austria will be presented.

As such, attempts to emulate them using machine learning should reflect this. While the use of machine learning to emulate weather forecast models is a relatively new endeavour, there is a rich history of climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is an initial condition problem, which intimately depends on the current state of the atmosphere, climate modelling is predominantly a boundary condition problem. To emulate the response of the climate to different drivers therefore, representation of the full dynamical evolution of the atmosphere is neither necessary, or in many cases, desirable. Climate scientists are typically interested in different questions also. Indeed emulating the steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g. parameter estimation. Nevertheless, the large datasets, non-linear relationships and limited training data make climate a domain which is rich in interesting machine learning challenges. Here, I seek to set out the current state of climate model emulation and demonstrate how, despite some challenges, recent advances in machine learning provide new opportunities for creating useful statistical models of the climate.

The winter Olympics track is located on very complex terrain, and a detailed weather forecast is needed. A Post-processing method based on machine learning is used for the future-10-days weather prediction with 1-km spatial resolution and 1-hour temporal resolution, which can greatly improve accuracy and refinement of numerical weather prediction(NWP). The ECWMF/RMAPS model data and the automatic weather station data(AWS) from 2015-2018 are prepared for the training data and test data, included 48 features and 4 labels (the observed 2m temperature, relative humidity, 10m wind speed and wind direction ). The model data are grid point, while the AWS data are station point. We take the nearest 9 model point to predict the station point, instead of making an interpolation between the grid point and station point. Then the feature number will be 48*9 in dataset. The interpolation error from grid point to station is eliminated,and the spatial distribution is considered to some extent. Machine leaning method we used are SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree(GBDT) and XGBoost. We find that XGBoost method performs best, slightly better than GBDT and Random Forest. It is noted that we did some feature engineering work before training, and we found that it's not that the more features, the better the model, while 10 features are enough. Also there is an interesting thing that the features that closely related the labels values becomes less important as the forecast time increases,such as the model outputed 2m temperature, 10m wind speed and wind direction. While some features that forecasters don't pay attention to become more important in the 6-10 days prediction, such as latent heat flux, snow depth and so on. So it's necessary to train the model based on dynamic weight parameters for different forecast time. Through the post-processing based on the machine learning method, the forecast accuracy has been greatly improved compared with EC model. The averaged forecast accuracy of 0-10 days for 2m relative humidity, 10m wind speed and direction has been increased by almost 15%, and the temperature accuracy has been increased by 20%~40% ( 40% for 0-3 days, and the accuracy decreased with the forecast time ).",2020/5/1,2021/10/6 13:58,2021/10/6 13:58,2021/10/6 13:58,10463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020EGUGA..2210463Y,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using data from a large-ensemble fully coupled Earth system model, CapsNets are trained on midtropospheric large-scale circulation patterns (Z500) labeled 0–4 depending on the existence and geographical region of surface temperature extremes over North America several days ahead.

Using both surface temperature and Z500, accuracies (recalls) with CapsNets increase to 80% (88%). In both cases, CapsNets outperform simpler techniques such as convolutional neural networks and logistic regression, and their accuracy is least affected as the size of the training set is reduced.

Accurate and timely weather prediction has always been the goal of meteorological scientists. However, the conventional theory-driven numerical weather prediction (NWP) methods face many challenges, such as incomplete understanding of physical mechanisms, difficulties in obtaining useful knowledge from the deluge of observation data, and the requirement of powerful computing resources. With the successful application of data-driven deep learning method in various fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, and time series prediction, it has been proven that deep learning method can effectively mine the temporal and spatial features from the spatio-temporal data. Meteorological data is a typical big geospatial data. Deep learning-based weather prediction (DLWP) is expected to be a strong supplement to the conventional method.

The quantification of wind resource uncertainty is especially important for offshore wind energy, given the challenges connected to the direct observation of the wind flow offshore. Numerical weather prediction models represent a valuable way to characterize the wind resource offshore. The uncertainty associated to modeled wind speed can be estimated by running multiple ensemble members, obtained by perturbing initial conditions, external forcings, or numerical schemes. However, creating such a numerical ensemble of long-term wind resource data over a large region represents a challenge given the substantial computational capacity it requires. Here, we quantify uncertainty in hub height wind speed in a region covering the proposed offshore wind energy lease areas in California.

For this purpose, POLRAD radar reflectivity, EUCLID lightning detection data, and convective indices calculated from the ERA5 reanalysis are combined and then compared with large hail reports from Poland (2008–2017). The data fusion of multiple sources, coupled with the machine learning approach, makes it possible to greatly improve the robustness of large hail prediction compared to any single product commonly used in operational forecasting. This is especially noticeable with the reduced number of false alarms. Although the created machine learning models are mainly driven by radar reflectivity, composite thermodynamic and kinematic indices such as Hail Size Index (HSI), Significant Hail Parameter (SHIP), Large Hail Parameter (LGHAIL), and WMAXSHEAR provide an added value to a model's performance.

The process studied is atmospheric gravity waves which need to be parameterized in climate models. In these parameterizations, an essential yet poorly constrained component is the launch spectrum of non-orographic waves in the troposphere or lowermost stratosphere. We make use of the fact that current Numerical Weather Prediction models, with a spatial resolution of only a few tens of kilometers, describe well the variations of the gravity wave field, although it remains only partly unresolved (Jewtoukoff et al 2015). Hence the ERA5 reanalyses at full resolution provide us knowledge of the subgrid-scale process to estimate (the target): gravity waves at 100 hPa, quantified by the variance of vertical velocity or the associated momentum fluxes. We employ a 5-month data-set (May to September 2018), for a mid-latitude region of the Indian Ocean far from land masses and orographic obstacles. Explanatory variables are Low-resolution ERA5 data (2.5°×2.5°) through the troposphere (from 1000 to 100 hPa) including wind speed, relative vorticity, temperature gradients, and the Fraction of Cloud cover. As a first exploration of the capacity to reconstruct information on gravity waves from a low-resolution description of the tropospheric flow, we have used Random Forests as a non-parametric statistical model which readily provides information on the relative importance of the different explanatory variables. The statistical model is trained and tested using 10-fold cross-validation. The gravity wave diagnostics are reconstructed from knowledge of the tropospheric flow with promising agreement: correlation coefficients between the target and the reconstructed time-series are 0.7 or better. We also performed another examination to train the model over the Indian Ocean and test it on another area over Indian and Southern Pacific Oceans. The statistical evaluation shows reasonable results again. This exploration provides insights for the development of gravity wave parameterizations: first, it indicates a lower bound on how much of the gravity wave signal can be reconstructed, given the low-resolution information on the tropospheric flow. Second, it ranks the tropospheric variables by order of relevance, revealing notably the importance of upper-level winds.",,2021/10/6 14:09,2021/10/6 14:10,2021/10/6 14:09,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/B35SNEIV/abstract.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LRKIEHSU,report,2021,"Keany, Eoghan; Bessardon, Geoffrey; Gleeson, Emily",Leveraging machine learning to produce a cost-effective national building height map of Ireland,,,,,https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EMS2021/EMS2021-48.html,"To represent surface thermal, turbulent and humidity exchanges, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems require a land-cover classification map to calculate sur-face parameters used in surface flux estimation. The latest land-cover classification map used in the HARMONIE-AROME configuration of the shared ALADIN-HIRLAMNWP system for operational weather forecasting is ECOCLIMAP-SG (ECO-SG). The first evaluation of ECO-SG over Ireland suggested that sparse urban areas are underestimated and instead appear as vegetation areas (1). While the work of (2) on land-cover classification helps to correct the horizontal extent of urban areas, the method does not provide information on the vertical characteristics of urban areas. ECO-SG urban classification implicitly includes building heights (3), and any improvement to ECO-SG urban area extent requires a complementary building height dataset. Openly accessible building height data at a national scale does not exist for the island of Ireland. This work seeks to address this gap in availability by extrapolating the preexisting localised building height data across the entire island. The study utilises information from both the temporal and spatial dimensions by creating band-wise temporal aggregation statistics from morphological operations, for both the Sentinel-1A/B and Sentinel-2A/B constellations (4). The extrapolation uses building height information from the Copernicus Urban Atlas, which contains regional coverage for Dublin at 10 m x10 m resolution (5). Various regression models were then trained on these aggregated statistics to make pixel-wise building height estimates. These model estimates were then evaluated with an adjusted RMSE metric, with the most accurate model chosen to map the entire country. This method relies solely on freely available satellite imagery and open-source software, providing a cost-effective mapping service at a national scale that can be updated more frequently, unlike expensive once-off private mapping services. Furthermore, this process could be applied by these services to reduce costs by taking a small representative sample and extrapolating the rest of the area. This method can be applied beyond national borders providing a uniform map that does not depends on the different private service practices facilitating the updates of global or continental land-cover information used in NWP.",2021/6/18,2021/10/6 14:10,2021/10/6 14:10,2021/10/6 14:10,,,,,,,,,,,,Copernicus Meetings,,en,,,,,meetingorganizer.copernicus.org,,Conference Name: EMS2021 DOI: 10.5194/ems2021-48,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/IDS6PUAD/Keany et al. - 2021 - Leveraging machine learning to produce a cost-effe.pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/FGEWEAED/EMS2021-48.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,EMS2021-48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To use this information for data assimilation and for the evaluation of numerical weather prediction models, sufficiently fast and accurate forward operators are required, which compute synthetic satellite images from the model state. At these wavelengths, scattering is important, which makes radiative transfer methods complicated and computationally expensive. Only recently, a fast method for visible images has become available, which is based on a compressed eight-dimensional reflectance look-up table computed with a much slower standard radiative transfer method. While the usefulness of this operator has been demonstrated, it is restricted to clouds and non-absorbing channels. Taking aerosols and additional effects like absorption by water vapor into account with the same approach is not very practical, as it would require additional dimensions and thus a strongly increased table size. Here we report on using feed-forward neural networks as an alternative to the look-up table and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve a comparable speed and accuracy. The amount of training data and the memory required by the operator can be reduced by orders of magnitude, which makes additional input dimensions feasible. Moreover, the neural-network approach has an advantage for variational or hybrid data assimilation systems: Tangent-linear and adjoint versions of the neural network inference code can easily be derived for arbitrary network structures and do not have to be changed when the network is trained with different data.",2020/12/1,2021/10/6 14:11,2021/10/6 14:11,2021/10/6 14:11,A059-0004,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020AGUFMA059.0004S,,,,,INFORMATICS; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES; 3311 Clouds and aerosols; 1906 Computational models; 1914 Data mining; 1922 Forecasting; algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current surface layer parameterizations are based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory, which links the near surface vertical profiles of wind, temperature, and moisture to their relevant fluxes through the use of empirical functions conditioned on the stability of the surface layer. While these empirical functions agree closely with observations under homogeneous conditions, there are many situations in which observed fluxes do not match the estimates from similarity theory. Therefore, the goal of this project is to train a diverse set of machine learning approaches on multi-year time series of surface layer and flux observations. We have acquired surface layer observations from meteorological towers in Cabauw, Netherlands, and Idaho, United States.

The hypothesis of this study is that growth and decay is more predictable in mountainous regions, which represent a potential source of practical predictability by machine learning methods. In this paper, artificial neural networks (ANN) are employed to learn the complex nonlinear dependence relating the growth and decay to the input predictors, which are geographical location, mesoscale motion vectors, freezing level height, and time of the day. The average long-term growth and decay patterns are effectively reproduced by the ANN, which allows exploring their climatology for any combination of predictors. Due to the low intrinsic predictability of growth and decay, its prediction in real time is more challenging, but is substantially improved when adding persistence information to the predictors, more precisely the growth and decay and precipitation intensity in the immediate past. The improvement is considerable in mountainous regions, where, depending on flow direction, the root-mean-square error of ANN predictions can be 20%–30% lower compared with persistence. Because large uncertainty is associated with precipitation forecasting, deterministic machine learning predictions should be coupled with a model for the predictive uncertainty. Therefore, we consider a probabilistic perspective by estimating prediction intervals based on a combination of quantile decision trees and ANNs. The probabilistic framework is an attempt to address the problem of conditional bias, which often characterizes deterministic machine learning predictions obtained by error minimization.</p></section>",2019/10/1,2021/10/6 14:11,2021/10/6 14:11,2021/10/6 14:11,1547-1569,,5,34,,,Using a 10-Year Radar Archive for Nowcasting Precipitation Growth and Decay,,,,,,,EN,,,,,journals.ametsoc.org,,Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Weather and Forecasting,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/MXURH5UW/Foresti et al. - 2019 - Using a 10-Year Radar Archive for Nowcasting Preci.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Machine learning (ML) can be used to learn new parameterizations directly from high-resolution model output, but it remains poorly understood how such parameterizations behave when fully coupled in a general circulation model (GCM) and whether they are useful for simulations of climate change or extreme events. Here we focus on these issues using idealized tests in which an ML-based parameterization is trained on output from a conventional parameterization and its performance is assessed in simulations with a GCM. We use an ensemble of decision trees (random forest) as the ML algorithm, and this has the advantage that it automatically ensures conservation of energy and nonnegativity of surface precipitation. The GCM with the ML convective parameterization runs stably and accurately captures important climate statistics including precipitation extremes without the need for special training on extremes. Climate change between a control climate and a warm climate is not captured if the ML parameterization is only trained on the control climate, but it is captured if the training includes samples from both climates. Remarkably, climate change is also captured when training only on the warm climate, and this is because the extratropics of the warm climate provides training samples for the tropics of the control climate. In addition to being potentially useful for the simulation of climate, we show that ML parameterizations can be interrogated to provide diagnostics of the interaction between convection and the large-scale environment.",2018,2021/10/6 14:11,2021/10/6 14:11,2021/10/6 14:11,2548-2563,,10,10,,,Using Machine Learning to Parameterize Moist Convection,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2018MS001351,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/LWLBNYLH/O'Gorman i Dwyer - 2018 - Using Machine Learning to Parameterize Moist Conve.pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/J6Y8QKZN/2018MS001351.html,,,climate change; machine learning; extreme events; moist convection; parameterization; subgrid modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RO is well known for providing very high vertical resolution measurements of microwave refractivity. However, cloud water fields themselves contribute weakly to microwave refractivity, but they do leave other signatures in refractivity profiles that are commonly linked to their presence. These include refractivity enhancements brought on by large amounts of water vapor and/or altered temperature lapse rates. When accompanied by forecasts of temperature and density from numerical weather prediction, RO retrievals of refractivity and ""dry temperature"" are expected to contain information on the presence of clouds that can be mined using modern machine learning (ML) approaches. We are assembling a large collection of RO profiles along with coincident NWP forecast fields of temperature, water vapor and cloud water, and corresponding contemporaneous GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) sensor data sets. Cloud truth fields are established for each RO profile using a hybrid cloud modeling technique that exploits the information content of the ABI and GFS cloud-water datasets. Coupled with refractivity and dry-temperature observations from the second-generation Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC-2), we are designing ML techniques that categorize the cloud state within RO profiles. The ML model is being designed to match ABI-based cloud observations (i.e., cloud/no-cloud, and perhaps other properties including cloud fraction) from corresponding RO profiles. We are experimenting with multiple ML approaches including the xgboost algorithm and custom-built deep neural networks in order to probe the potential of the RO data to diagnose cloud properties. Initial decision-tree experiments show strong promise, explaining up to 70% of the variability in GFS forecast relative humidity based on RO observables.

This reverse flow is absent in QuikSCAT and ASCAT satellite wind climatologies, likely due to the reliance on external ""nudge"" wind fields in scatterometer wind processing, which are typically coarse numerical weather prediction wind fields that poorly represent orographic features. The reliance on nudge wind fields is necessary to select from among multiple ambiguous wind solutions for given microwave observations. Here we utilize wind fields from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to explore statistical downscaling of orographically forced winds in the Big Island wake region. We mask the wake region in the model winds, and develop statistical models of the wake region winds as a function of the winds in the surrounding region. Using the WRF winds as training data, we apply and compare multiple supervised methods to reconstruct winds in the lee wind region from winds in the surrounding region: linear Maximum Covariance and Cross Correlation Analysis (MCA/CCA); and feed-forward and convolutional neural networks. We then compare the length of training times to determine the optimal method, given a varied amount of dynamic model generated (WRF) data. This work aims to determine the benefit of nonlinear relationships inherent to deep learning methods relative to traditional methods for spatial reconstruction.

Among these digital technologies, Artificial intelligence has become a must in recent years. If the shift towards artificial intelligence-based solutions is only happening now, it is thanks to the explosion of computing power of computers, the introduction of new algorithms enabling to take advantage of Machine Learning's analysis and prediction capabilities along with the volume of available data generated in real time by sensors and Internet of Things activators. Artificial intelligence is already revolutionizing several industrial sectors. In the energy field, its ability to learn from data allows for the optimization of both energy generation and consumption. Energy needs are better assessed in order to enhance the energy transition. Therefore, this study aims to explore the development potential of artificial intelligence solutions in the energy sector. A performance comparison of several up-to-date Machine learning algorithms is conducted for the hourly prediction of the resulting power of photovoltaic panels. The model offering the best accuracy is identified using the most common performance metrics including R-squared, Root Mean Square Error, and Mean Absolute Error.

Lightning prediction plays a vital role in lightning disaster reduction. Existing prediction methods, usually based on numerical weather models, rely on lightning parameterization schemes for forecasting. These methods, however, have two drawbacks. Firstly, simulations of the numerical weather models usually have deviations in space and time domains, which introduces irreparable biases to subsequent parameterization processes. Secondly, the lightning parameterization schemes are designed manually by experts in meteorology, which means these schemes can hardly benefit from abundant historical data. In this work, we propose a data-driven model based on neural networks, referred to as LightNet, for lightning prediction. Unlike the conventional prediction methods which are fully based on numerical weather models, LightNet introduces recent lightning observations in an attempt to calibrate the simulations and assist the prediction. LightNet first extracts spatiotemporal features of the simulations and observations via dual encoders. These features are then combined by a fusion module. Finally, the fused features are fed into a spatiotemporal decoder to make forecasts. We conduct experimental evaluations on a real-world North China lightning dataset, which shows that LightNet achieves a threefold improvement in equitable threat score for six-hour prediction compared with three established forecast methods.",2019/7/25,2021/12/3 13:32,2021/12/3 13:32,2021/12/3,2439–2447,,,,,,LightNet,KDD '19,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,convolutional neural network; deep learning; lightning prediction; spatiotemporal data mining; time series prediction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aviation icing is a phenomenon in which an ice film is formed on the surface and/or engine of the aircraft. When icing is formed, well-organized aerodynamic balance is contaminated, resulting aviation misleading. Super-cooled droplets (SCDs) rich clouds are considered as potential icing conditions, thus identifying those clouds are the key to prevent icing. Therefore, many studies about detecting icing potential clouds are conducted with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite remote sensed data. However, icing potential clouds are typically present in spatiotemporally inconstant forms, thus, geostationary satellite observations could be useful, while NWP has coarser spatiotemporal resolution. The current icing potential (CIP) system is in operation using meteorological products from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series, and the flight icing threat (FIT) system is being prepared to provide icing potential cloud warnings in the US. However, although several geostationary satellite sensor systems are available in East Asia, there are no operationally available icing detection models. In this study, two icing potential cloud detection systems are proposed, which are based on Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) sensor, and Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) products. COMS MI provides data in 5 channels in 15-minute intervals since April 2011, and Himawari-8 AHI provides data in 16 channels in 10-minute intervals since July 2015 till now. Two types of machine learning techniques are used to simulate potential icing identification—random forest (RF) and multinomial log-linear model (MLM) via neural networks. Quality controlled pilot reports (PIREPs) were used as reference data. Results showed that the COMS RF model produced a detection accuracy of 90% and a false detection rate of 20% while MLM produced a detection accuracy of 70% and a false detection rate of 15%. When the FIT model was applied to the same validation data, it resulted in a detection accuracy of 30% and a false detection rate of 45%. Both RF and MLM methods yielded the same detection and false-detection rates (i.e., 75% and 0%) for Himawari-8. However, reference data for Himawari-8 are not yet sufficient to develop robust machine learning models. The models for Himawari-8 will be further refined when more quality controlled PIREPs are available.",2018/4/1,2021/12/3 13:35,2021/12/3 13:35,2021/12/3 13:35,11483,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2018EGUGA..2011483S,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/BLQA4I75/Sim et al. - 2018 - Potential icing cloud detection from geostationary.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We considered ground-based radar data, satellite-based imagery and lightning observations, forecast data from numerical weather prediction (NWP) and the topography from a digital elevation model (DEM), ending up with 106 different predictive variables. We evaluated machine-learning models to nowcast radar reflectivity (representing precipitation), lightning occurrence, and the 45&thinsp;dBZ radar echo top height that can be used as an indicator of hail, producing predictions for lead times up to 60&thinsp;min. The study was carried out in an area in the northeast United States, where observations from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 16 are available and can be used as a proxy for the upcoming Meteosat Third Generation capabilities in Europe. The benefits of the data sources were evaluated using two complementary approaches: using feature importance reported by the machine learning model based on gradient boosted trees, and by repeating the analysis using all possible combinations of the data sources. The two approaches sometimes yielded seemingly contradictory results, as the feature importance reported by the gradient boosting algorithm sometimes disregards certain features that are still useful in the absence of more powerful predictors, while at times it overstates the importance of other features. We found that the radar data is overall the most important predictor, the satellite imagery is beneficial for all of the studied predictands, and the lightning data is very useful for nowcasting lightning but of limited use for the other hazards. The benefits of the NWP data are more limited over the nowcast period, and we did not find evidence that the nowcast benefits from the DEM data.</p>",2021/6/22,2021/12/3 13:35,2021/12/3 13:35,2021/12/3 13:35,28-1月,,,,,,Nowcasting thunderstorm hazards using machine learning,,,,,,,English,,,,,nhess.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/PJ67DKAP/Leinonen et al. - 2021 - Nowcasting thunderstorm hazards using machine lear.pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/R8JY26DK/nhess-2021-171.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper proposes a dual-input dual-encoder recurrent neural network, namely Rainfall Nowcasting Network (RN-Net), to solve this problem. It takes the past grid rainfall data interpolated by automatic weather stations and doppler radar mosaic data as input data, and then forecasts the grid rainfall data for the next 2 h.

Feature selection is an important problem in machine learning, both in classification and regression problems. In renewable energy systems, feature selection appears related to prediction systems in the most important sources such as wind, solar and marine resources. The objective of the paper is twofold: first, a review of the most important prediction systems for renewable energy applications involving feature selection is carried out. Analysis and discussion of different feature selection problems in prediction systems are considered. We show that wrapper FSP approaches are those mostly used due to their higher performance. They include a diversity of algorithms, prevailing fast-training approaches. The lack of an uniform framework for FSP and the diversity of tackled problems impede a systematic assessment of the performance and properties of the applied methods. Thus, the simultaneously use of several global search mechanisms should be the preferred option. In a second part of the paper, we explore this possibility, by introducing a novel approach for feature selection based on a novel meta-heuristic, the Coral Reefs Optimization algorithm with Substrate Layer. This approach is able to combine different search mechanisms into a single algorithm, providing a global search procedure of high quality. We use an Extreme Learning Machine for prediction within this novel approach. The performance of the system is evaluated in a problem of wind speed prediction from numerical models input, using real data from a wind farm in Spain, where comparison with alternative regression algorithms is carried out. Improvements up to 20% in hourly and daily wind speed prediction are obtained with the proposed system versus the algorithms without the feature selection process considered.",2018/7/1,2021/12/3 13:36,2021/12/3 13:36,2021/12/3 13:36,728-741,,,90,,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Coral reefs optimization algorithm; Extreme learning machines; Feature selection problems; Prediction problems; Renewable energy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Outdoor high-temperature operations in summer and work in the severe cold in winter both require accurate temperature forecasts, which could guide people to take more effective precautions to adopt to the changing temperature. In most cases, among plentiful existing temperature prediction models, the LDAPS (Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System) established by the Korea Meteorological Agency and the NU-WRF (NASA-Unified WRF) created by NASA are used for prediction, but these two models can still find inaccurate predictions in practical applications. Through further observation, it is found that these models are highly based on subjective experience or judgment, which leads to the problem of low prediction accuracy. Consequently, in this article, we intend to explore the LDAPS model in depth, by focusing on machine learning algorithms to correct the deviation of the model. To be more specific, we use a series of classical machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machine, linear regression, and tree-base ensemble learning methods (random forest and boosting) to adjust the predicted values via using the data set from the UCI machine learning repository. Through the comparison of these models, we found that the random forest and the boosting model perform best, whose RMSE (root of mean square error) on the test data set are 0.9718 and 0.9625 for maximum temperature prediction, 0.7598 and 0.6568 for minimum temperature predication respectively.",2021/4/23,2021/12/3 13:36,2021/12/3 13:36,2021/12/3,1–6,,,,,,,ICMLT 2021,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,ACM Digital Library,,,,,,,Decision tree; ensemble learning; LDAPS model; linear regression; Support vector machine,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new system is scheduled to go into operation later in 2020. The performance of viable GPUs at a given price has not been sufficiently increasing in recent years. With a fixed budget envelope, the traditional design for operational NWP with two, fully redundant and self-contained systems, was no longer viable to support operations of the 2020–2024 model.

Specifically, concept of network tenants is introduced to define a production, a failover/research-and-development (R&D) and a system test-and-development tenant. Moreover, operational resiliency metrics are ensured via transparent migration of components, similar to cloud environments but with subtle differences to ensure bare-metal performance and scaling of MeteoSwiss simulations.

Yet, precipitation nowcasting based on spatiotemporal extrapolation tends to provide a better precipitation forecast at shorter lead times with much less computation. Therefore, merging the precipitation forecasts from the NWP and extrapolation systems would be a viable approach to quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF). Although the optimal weights between the NWP and extrapolation systems are usually defined as a global constant, the weights would vary in space, particularly for global QPF. This study proposes a method to find the optimal weights at each location using the local threat score (LTS), a spatially localized version of the threat score. We test the locally optimal weighting with a global NWP system composed of the local ensemble transform Kalman filter and the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM-LETKF). For the extrapolation system, the RIKEN’s global precipitation nowcasting system called GSMaP_RNC is used. GSMaP_RNC extrapolates precipitation patterns from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)’s Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP). The benefit of merging in global precipitation forecast lasts longer compared to regional precipitation forecast.

In this study, a correction method for the data from the NWP model is developed to obtain more skillful forecast data. The proposed method fuses information about surface global horizontal solar irradiance (GHI) from the NWP model and the satellite observations and gives corrected forecast data over the domain of the NWP model. There are three steps in the correction method algorithm. First, grid cells of the NWP model are grouped into clusters based on atmospheric conditions and regions. Second, cumulative distribution functions of the GHI from both datasets are inferred for each cluster separately. Last, correction functions are built using the statistical transformation. The correction effect is evaluated using satellite observation data as the reference. These analyses are performed using data for Japan. The correction function generally improves the forecast quality measured with the mean bias error (MBE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). When the forecast quality is measured with MBE, the improvement lasts for two forecast days, but when measured with MAE and RMSE, the improvement lasts for only one forecast day.

Postprocessing is required to maximize the usefulness of probabilistic guidance from an ensemble of convection-allowing model forecasts. Machine learning (ML) models have become popular methods for postprocessing severe weather guidance since they can leverage numerous variables to discover useful patterns in complex datasets. In this study, we develop and evaluate a series of ML models to produce calibrated, probabilistic severe weather guidance from WoF System (WoFS) output. Our dataset includes WoFS ensemble forecasts available every 5 min out to 150 min of lead time from the 2017–19 NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed Spring Forecasting Experiments (81 dates). Using a novel ensemble storm-track identification method, we extracted three sets of predictors from the WoFS forecasts: intrastorm state variables, near-storm environment variables, and morphological attributes of the ensemble storm tracks. We then trained random forests, gradient-boosted trees, and logistic regression algorithms to predict which WoFS 30-min ensemble storm tracks will overlap a tornado, severe hail, and/or severe wind report. To provide rigorous baselines against which to evaluate the skill of the ML models, we extracted the ensemble probabilities of hazard-relevant WoFS variables exceeding tuned thresholds from each ensemble storm track. The three ML algorithms discriminated well for all three hazards and produced more reliable probabilities than the baseline predictions. Overall, the results suggest that ML-based postprocessing of dynamical ensemble output can improve short-term, storm-scale severe weather probabilistic guidance.",2021/5/1,2021/12/3 13:39,2021/12/3 13:39,2021/12/3 13:39,1535-1557,,5,149,,,,,,,,,,EN,,,,,journals.ametsoc.org,,Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Monthly Weather Review,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/CHVFN75F/Flora et al. - 2021 - Using Machine Learning to Generate Storm-Scale Pro.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to its special geographical location and climate, eastern China is affected by different weather systems, such as monsoons, shear lines, typhoons, and extratropical cyclones. In the near future, the rainfall rate becomes difficult to predict precisely due to these systems. Traditional physics-based methods such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) tend to perform poorly on nowcasting problems due to the spin-up issue. Moreover, various meteorological stations are distributed in this region, generating a large amount of observation data every day, which have great potential for application to data-driven methods. Thus, it is important to train a data-driven model from scratch that is suitable for the specific weather situation of eastern China. However, due to the high degrees of freedom and nonlinearity of machine learning algorithms, it is difficult to add physical constraints. Therefore, with the intention of using various kinds of data as a proxy for physical constraints, we collected three kinds of data (radar, satellite, and precipitation data) in the flood season from 2017 to 2018 in this area and preprocessed them into tensors (<span class=""inline-formula"">256×256</span>) that cover eastern China with a domain of <span class=""inline-formula""><math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" id=""M2"" display=""inline"" overflow=""scroll"" dspmath=""mathml""><mrow><mn mathvariant=""normal"">12.8</mn><mo>×</mo><mn mathvariant=""normal"">12.8</mn><msup><mi/><mo>∘</mo></msup></mrow></math><span><svg:svg xmlns:svg=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" width=""60pt"" height=""11pt"" class=""svg-formula"" dspmath=""mathimg"" md5hash=""c3998ea99aa59a8a455d3cc389a141ee""><svg:image xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xlink:href=""gmd-14-4019-2021-ie00001.svg"" width=""60pt"" height=""11pt"" src=""gmd-14-4019-2021-ie00001.png""/></svg:svg></span></span>. The developed multisource data model (MSDM) combines the optical flow, random forest, and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms. It treats the precipitation nowcasting task as an image-to-image problem, which takes radar and satellite data with an interval of 30 min as inputs and predicts radar echo intensity with a lead time of 30 min. To reduce the smoothing caused by convolutions, we use the optical flow algorithm to predict satellite data in the following 120 min. The predicted radar echoes from the MSDM together with satellite data from the optical flow algorithm are recursively implemented in the MSDM to achieve a 120 min lead time. The MSDM predictions are comparable to those of other baseline models with a high temporal resolution of 6 min. To solve blurry image problems, we applied a modified structural similarity (SSIM) index as a loss function. Furthermore, we use the random forest algorithm with predicted radar and satellite data to estimate the rainfall rate, and the results outperform those of the traditional, nonlinear radar reflectivity factor and rainfall rate (<span class=""inline-formula""><i>Z</i></span>–<span class=""inline-formula""><i>R</i></span>) relationships that use logarithmic functions. The experiments confirm that machine learning with multisource data provides more reasonable predictions and reveals a better nonlinear relationship between radar echo and precipitation rate. Apart from developing complicated machine learning algorithms, exploiting the potential of multisource data will yield more improvements.</p>",2021/6/29,2021/12/3 13:42,2021/12/3 13:42,2021/12/3 13:42,4019-4034,,6,14,,,MSDM v1.0,,,,,,,English,,,,,gmd.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/T2EVIR2Z/Li et al. - 2021 - MSDM v1.0 A machine learning model for precipitat.pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/CL8VS8IW/2021.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most popular probabilistic solar forecasting methods is to feed simulated explanatory weather scenarios into a deterministic forecasting model. However, the correlation among different explanatory weather variables are seldom considered during the scenario generation process. This paper presents an improved probabilistic solar power forecasting framework based on correlated weather scenario generation. Copula is used to model a multivariate joint distribution between predicted weather variables and observed weather variables. Massive weather scenarios are obtained by deriving a conditional probability density function given a current weather prediction by using the Bayesian theory. The generated weather scenarios are used as input variables to a machine learning-based multi-model solar power forecasting model, where probabilistic solar power forecasts are obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed probabilistic solar power forecasting framework is validated by using seven solar farms from the 2000-bus synthetic grid system in Texas. Numerical results of case studies at the seven sites show that the developed probabilistic solar power forecasting methodology has improved the pinball loss metric score by up to 140% compared to benchmark models.",2020/5/15,2021/12/3 13:42,2021/12/3 13:42,2021/12/3 13:42,114823,,,266,,Applied Energy,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/HUJ4ELU6/S0306261920303354.html,,,Copula; Gaussian mixture model; Gibbs sampling; Probabilistic solar power forecasting; Weather scenario generation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the adequate exploition of these multi-source ST data emerges as a promising but challenging topic for weather forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a data-driven forecasting framework (referred to as LightNet+) based on deep neural networks using a lightning scenario. Our framework design enables LightNet+ to make forecasts by mining complementary information distributed across multiple data sources, which may be heterogeneous in spatial (continuous versus discrete) and temporal (observations from the past versus simulation of the future) domains. We evaluate LightNet+ using a real-world weather dataset in North China. The experimental results demonstrate: (a) LightNet+ produces significantly better forecasts than three established lightning schemes, and (b) the more data sources are fed into LightNet+, the higher forecasting quality it achieves.",,2021/12/3 13:42,2021/12/3 13:42,2021/12/3 13:42,,,n/a,n/a,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/qj.4167,,,,,data assimilation; deep learning; spatiotemporal data; weather forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The approach is computationally efficient, requiring just three minutes on a single GPU to produce a 320-member set of six-week forecasts at 1.4{\deg} resolution. Ensemble spread is primarily produced by randomizing the CNN training process to create a set of 32 DLWP models with slightly different learned weights. Although our DLWP model does not forecast precipitation, it does forecast total column water vapor, and it gives a reasonable 4.5-day deterministic forecast of Hurricane Irma. In addition to simulating mid-latitude weather systems, it spontaneously generates tropical cyclones in a one-year free-running simulation. Averaged globally and over a two-year test set, the ensemble mean RMSE retains skill relative to climatology beyond two-weeks, with anomaly correlation coefficients remaining above 0.6 through six days. Our primary application is to subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting at lead times from two to six weeks. Current forecast systems have low skill in predicting one- or 2-week-average weather patterns at S2S time scales.

Improvements to operational NWP model forecasts are generally assumed to provide significant economic savings through better decision making. But is this true? Since 2014, several new versions of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model were released into operation within the National Weather Service. Practically, forecasts have an economic impact only if they lead to a different action than what would be taken under an alternative information set. And in many sectors, these decisions only need to be considered during certain weather conditions. We estimate the economic impacts of improvements made to the HRRR, using 12-hour wind, precipitation, and temperature forecasts in several cases where they can have “economically meaningful” behavioral consequences. We examine three different components of the U.S. economy where such information matters: 1) better integration of wind energy resources into the electric grid, 2) increased worker output due to better precipitation forecasts that allow workers to arrive to their jobs on time, and 3) better decisions by agricultural producers in preparing for freezing conditions.

Sri Lanka is also facing these climate changes over the past few decades. It has resulted in rainfall pattern changes where the expected rain may not occur during the expected time and amount. The mismatch between the rainfall pattern and traditional seasonal cultivation schedule has critically affected the agricultural sustainability. Even with the current technological advancements, weather prediction is one of the most technically and scientifically challenging tasks. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based approach for predicting rainfall for precision agriculture in Sri Lanka and it can be recognized as the first attempt to validate machine learning models to predict the weather in Sri Lankan context for precision agriculture. By analyzing the nature of the weather in Sri Lanka, the relationship of weather attributes with agriculture, availability, and accessibility, seven attributes are selected including rain gauge, relative humidity, average temperature, wind speed, wind direction where solar radiation and ozone concentration are uniquely selected for Sri Lankan context. For the prediction model, cross-validated data are trained and tested with four machine learning algorithms: Multiple Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. Currently, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors models have achieved accuracies of 88.57%, 88.66%. Random Forest has been recognized as the best-fitted model with 89.16% accuracy.

CASA’s nowcast framework displayed better primer outcomes than the WRF Model forecast for the lead time of 1 h and 30 min. After that time, the predictive ability of the nowcast framework began decreasing compared to the WRF Model. To broaden CASA’s predictive system lead time to 6 h, the WRF Model forecasts were blended with Dynamic and Adaptive Radar Tracking of Storms (DARTS) nowcast. The HRRR model analysis was used as initial and boundary conditions in the WRF Model. The high-resolution dual-pol radar observations were assimilated into the WRF Model through the 3DVAR data assimilation technique.

Deterministic methods are unable to accurately forecast the intermittent solar power generation since they depend on unique sets of inputs and outputs. Therefore, stochastic methods and artificially intelligent (AI) strategies are utilized for solar power forecast. In this work, a neural network (NN)-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) model is developed for a residential microgrid in San Diego, California considering all key weather parameters such as cloud coverage, dew point, solar zenith angle, precipitation, humidity, temperature, and pressure in the year 2016.

To validate the accuracy of the model, the solar irradiance and generated solar power in the residential microgrid are predicted for the year 2017 using the obtained NN-based model. The results are compared with the actual solar irradiance and power in 2017 to evaluate and validate the accuracy of the developed model.

This paper aims to improving the accuracy of short-term PV power predictions. Firstly, Measured power data, satellite-based data and numerical weather prediction data are utilized. The data sets of these sources are preprocessed and fused with machine learning techniques to get the sequence feature information. In particular, support vector machine based on data fusion (SVM-DF) is proposed to run as the main regression model. SVM-DF is an extension of the support vector machine and is capable of learning regression functions in continuous space by identifying structures in the mapping of input to output data. One advantage over Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is its ability to construct non-linear dependencies between the input and output data sets. Compared with predicting the PV power through classical ANN model, the SVM-DF approach acquire a more accurate dataset. Predictions of the higher quality can be achieved by SVM-DF with access to PV measurements and weather forecasts. To study further possible improvements in prediction quality, a study on NWP weather parameters, is performed to evaluate their suitability as input features for PV power forecasting. The results confirm the importance of data fusion which make use of spatio-temporal correlations between stations.

Using a composite-based analysis, cloud objects derived from high-resolution (500 m) model simulations are compared to 5-min GOES-16 imagery for a case study day located near the Alabama–Mississippi border. Observed and simulated cloud characteristics for clouds reaching CI are examined by utilizing infrared BTs commonly used in satellite-based CI nowcasting methods. The results demonstrate the ability of object-based verification methods with satellite observations to evaluate the evolution of model cloud characteristics, and the BT comparison provides insight into a known issue of model simulations producing too many convective cells reaching CI. The timing of CI from the different microphysical schemes is dependent on the production of ice in the upper levels of the cloud, which typically occurs near the time of maximum cloud growth. In particular, large differences in precipitation formation drive differences in the amount of cloud water able to reach upper layers of the cloud, which impacts cloud-top glaciation. Larger cloud mixing ratios are found in clouds with sustained growth leading to more cloud water lofted to the upper levels of the cloud and the formation of ice. Clouds unable to sustain growth lack the necessary cloud water needed to form ice and grow into cumulonimbus. Clouds with slower growth rates display similar BT trends as clouds exhibiting growth, which suggests that forecasting CI using geostationary satellites might require additional information beyond those derived at cloud top.",2021/4/1,2021/12/3 13:03,2021/12/3 13:03,2021/12/3 13:03,1153-1172,,4,149,,,,,,,,,,EN,,,,,journals.ametsoc.org,,Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Monthly Weather Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using precipitation and numerous instability indices from the deterministic model HARMONIE–AROME (HA; a nonhydrostatic numerical weather prediction model) as potential predictors, we generate summer areal probabilistic maximum hourly precipitation forecasts across 11 regions of the Netherlands. We compare the skill of three statistical postprocessing methods: an extended logistic regression (ELR), a zero-adjusted gamma distribution (ZAGA), and a machine learning-based method, quantile regression forests (QRF). Forecast skill for low and moderate precipitation thresholds increases with the inclusion of extra predictors, in addition to HA precipitation. HA precipitation is the most important predictor at all lead times in ELR and QRF, while in ZAGA, the most important predictor for the location parameter shifts over lead times from HA precipitation to indices of atmospheric instability. All three methods improve upon a climatological forecast for low and moderate precipitation thresholds. ZAGA and QRF are generally the most skillful methods at moderate thresholds. QRF tends to be the most skillful method at higher thresholds, particularly during the afternoon period. Forecasts are reliable at low and moderate thresholds but tend to be overconfident at higher thresholds. QRF and ZAGA have more potential economic value than the deterministic forecast, with value remaining at high thresholds.

The data provided by this approach are playing a consistently significant role in atmospheric research and related applications. This paper mainly summarizes the applications of RO to numerical weather prediction (NWP) generally and specifically for tropical cyclone (TC) forecast and outlines the prospects of the RO technique. With advantages such as high precision and accuracy, high vertical resolution, full-time and all-weather, and global coverage, RO data have made a remarkable contribution to NWP and TC forecasts. While accounting for only 7% of the total observations in European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts&rsquo; (ECMWF&rsquo;s) assimilation system, RO has the fourth-largest impact on NWP. The greater the amount of RO data, the better the forecast of NWP. In cases of TC forecasts, assimilating RO data from heights below 6 km and from the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) region contributes to the forecasting accuracy of the track and intensity of TCs in different stages. A statistical analysis showed that assimilating RO data can help restore the critical characteristics of TCs, such as the location and intensity of the eye, eyewall, and rain bands. Moreover, a non-local excess phase assimilation operator can be employed to optimize the assimilation results. With denser RO profiles expected in the future, the accuracy of TC forecast can be further improved.

This is typically accomplished with ensemble prediction systems, which consist of many perturbed numerical weather simulations, or trajectories, run in parallel. These systems are associated with a high computational cost and often involve statistical post-processing steps to inexpensively improve their raw prediction qualities. We propose a mixed model that uses only a subset of the original weather trajectories combined with a post-processing step using deep neural networks. These enable the model to account for non-linear relationships that are not captured by current numerical models or post-processing methods. Applied to the global data, our mixed models achieve a relative improvement in ensemble forecast skill (CRPS) of over 14%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the improvement is larger for extreme weather events on select case studies. We also show that our post-processing can use fewer trajectories to achieve comparable results to the full ensemble.

Atmospheric dynamics is extremely complicated to model, and chaos theory teaches us that the mathematical equations used to predict the weather are sensitive to initial conditions; that is, slightly perturbed initial conditions could yield very different forecasts. Over the years, meteorologists have developed a number of different mathematical models for atmospheric dynamics, each making slightly different assumptions and simplifications, and hence each yielding different forecasts. It has been noted that each model has its strengths and weaknesses forecasting in different situations, and hence to improve performance, scientists now use an ensemble forecast consisting of different models and running those models with different initial conditions. This ensemble method uses statistical post-processing; usually linear regression. Recently, machine learning techniques have started to be applied to NWP. Studies of neural networks, logistic regression, and genetic algorithms have shown improvements over standard linear regression for precipitation prediction. Gagne et al proposed using multiple machine learning techniques to improve precipitation forecasting. They used Breiman’s random forest technique, which had previously been applied to other areas of meteorology. Performance was verified using Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) data. Instead of using an ensemble forecast, it discusses the usage of techniques pertaining to machine learning to improve the precipitation forecast. This paper is to present an approach for mapping of precipitation data. The project attempts to arrive at a machine learning method which is optimal and data driven for predicting precipitation levels that aids farmers thereby aiming to provide benefits to the agricultural domain.",2021/11/17,2021/12/3 13:05,2021/12/3 13:05,2021/12/3 13:05,781-790,,4,72,,,,,,,,,,en,Copyright (c) 2021 MAUSAM,,,,103.215.208.102,,Number: 4,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/R9XEGSGQ/Alam i Amjad - 2021 - A precipitation forecasting model using machine le.pdf,,,Big data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondly, Considering ECMWF the forecast of ECMWF with multiple initial times, a double-model correction model based on XGBoost machine learning algorithm is proposed. To test the new approach for the daily max and min temperature forecasts, the 2-m surface air temperature in the China area from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and the observatory meteorological observation data from china national stations are used. The data ranged from July 2017 to September 2019. We used meal weight interpolation method and sliding time window method to construct sample data. The new approach is compared with the multiple linear regression, random forest and SVM algorithms which are often used in weather forecast correction, it shows better numerical performance.

ISJ579QY,journalArticle,2020,"Dujardin, J.; Lehning, M.",Multi-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network for High-Resolution Downscaling of Wind Fields from Operational Weather Prediction Models in Complex Terrain,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020AGUFMA073...06D,"Wind modelling in complex topography remains a challenging task because operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models have a spatial resolution that is too coarse to capture all the meaningful terrain-induced phenomena like channeling, blocking, speed-ups, or thermally driven flows. In addition, higher resolution NWP models are so computationally expensive that it is not possible to generate long time series, which are often necessary for the study of wind-induced phenomena like snow deposition and transport or wind energy potential assessment. Downscaling schemes are often used to generate higher resolution wind fields from coarser resolution models. They can approximately be categorized as dynamic, which use nested NWP models or flow solvers, or as statistical, for which relevant predictors are used to interpolate the wind fields to a higher resolution grid. On the one hand, the computational cost of dynamic downscaling schemes does not allow to generate long time series at high spatial resolution. On the other hand, statistical downscaling suffers from the same inaccuracies as their driving coarse-resolution datasets. We aimed at developing a downscaling scheme with the following capabilities: I. Fast enough to generate long time series of high-resolution (50 m) wind fields for large domains (whole mountain range, 10000 sq. km); II. Utilize the accuracy of measurement station networks. III. Generate wind fields that exhibit terrain dependencies, and not a simple interpolation of the coarser dataset. Our novel downscaling model uses several convolutional neural networks that combine, at multiple spatial resolutions, 2D information from a NWP model and various topographic descriptors. This combination of information is performed at the location of hundreds of measurement stations, which data are used as predictands. When trained, this model can predict at any location the wind vector given the local atmospheric state from the NWP model and the local topography.",2020/12/1,2021/12/3 13:07,2021/12/3 13:07,2021/12/3 13:07,A073-06,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020AGUFMA073...06D,,,,,1942 Machine learning; 3333 Model calibration; 3337 Global climate models; 3339 Ocean/atmosphere interactions; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES; INFORMATICS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regular flood events significantly affect in agricultural industries and human lives for economic losses. One of the reasons for these weather phenomena to sustain is latent heat release from Bay of Bengal (BoB) and Southeast Tropical Indian Ocean (SETIO). As the country has limited observations from stations and oceans, modeling for numerical weather prediction (NWP) are challenging for local operations. For operational NWP, computational resources and time are also concerns for a developing country like Bangladesh. Besides, recent machine learning (ML) techniques are widely applied to study various meteorological events with efficient results. Therefore, this research aims to estimate predictability and accuracy of supervised ML for tropical cyclones by assessing air temperature at 2 meter (AT) and sea surface temperature (SST). For AT and SST, the study utilizes monthly data at 0.25 × 0.25o horizontal resolution provided by the ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5). The gridded data is downscaled to area of interests such as coastal regions, BoB and SEITO with a study period of 40 years from 1979 to 2018. Furthermore, Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) provides AT for 36 years from 1979 to 2015. The experiments segregate into two sections: (1) data normalizations via linear regression (LR) and multi-linear regression (MLR) and (2) supervised ML techniques applications in Matlab 2018b. The pre-processed data for LR show that AT from coastal regions such as Chittagong (CG), Barishal (BR), and Khulna (KL) divisions have stronger correlations (R) to SST in BOB with R = 0.910, 0.850, and 0.846 respectively than SEITO (R = 0.698, 0.675 and 0.678 respectively). Moreover, for these three regions, the correlation of MLR is 0.916 and 0.745 for BoB and SEITO with residual standard error (RSE) 1.312 and 1.218 respectively. For supervised ML applications, coarse decision tree (CDT) predict SST based on AT with train (80%) and test (20%) of the ERA5 data. Finally, the results from CDT model indicate that SST predictions are possible with 98.5% accuracy based on coastal stations. The trained CDT also validated model prediction utilizing observed AT (BMD observations) to forecast monthly SST and found 85% accuracy for monthly time series. In conclusions, CDT can predict SST from station data and assess if there is any possibility for tropical cyclone formation. The future works include further assessment for various categories of tropical cyclone and predict their intensity based on SSTs. This research aims to contribute in disaster mitigation by improving early warning systems. The possibility of cyclone formations will help for preparedness in saving property damages in Bangladesh.",2021/4/1,2021/12/3 13:08,2021/12/3 13:08,2021/12/3 13:08,EGU21-14467,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2021EGUGA..2314467H,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
R76H53XW,journalArticle,2021,"Liang, Jianyu; Terasaki, Koji; Miyoshi, Takemasa",A machine learning approach to the observation operator for satellite radiance data assimilation,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EGUGA..2310475L,"The ""observation operator"" is essential in data assimilation (DA) to derive the model equivalent of the observations from the model variables. For satellite radiance observations, it is usually based on complex radiative transfer model (RTM) with a bias correction procedure. Therefore, it usually takes time to start using new satellite data after launching the satellites. Here we take advantage of the recent fast development of machine learning (ML) which is good at finding the complex relationships within data. ML can potentially be used as the ""observation operator"" to reveal the relationships between the model variables and the observations without knowing their physical relationships. In this study, we test with the numerical weather prediction system composed of the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) and the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). We focus on the satellite microwave brightness temperature (BT) from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A). Conventional observations and AMSU-A data were assimilated every 6 hours. The reference DA system employed the observation operator based on the RTTOV and an online bias correction method.We used this reference system to generate 1-month data to train the machine learning model. Since the reference system includes running a physically-based RTM, we implicitly used the information from RTM for training the ML model in this study, although in our future research we will explore methods without the use of RTM. The machine learning model is artificial neural networks with 5 fully connected layers. The input of the ML model includes the NICAM model variables and predictors for bias correction, and the output of the ML model is the corresponding satellite BT in 3 channels from 5 satellites. Next, we ran the DA cycle for the same month the following year to test the performance of the ML model. Two experiments were conducted. The control experiment (CTRL) was performed with the reference system. In the test experiment (TEST), the ML model was used as the observation operator and there is no separate bias correction procedure since the training includes biased differences between the model and observation. The results showed no significant bias of the simulated BT by the ML model. Using the ECMWF global atmospheric reanalysis (ERA-interim) as a benchmark to evaluate the analysis accuracy, the global-mean RMSE, bias, and ensemble spread for temperature in TEST are 2% higher, 4% higher, and 1% lower respectively than those in CTRL. The result is encouraging since our ML can emulate the RTM. The limitation of our study is that we rely on the physically-based RTM in the reference DA system, which is used for training the ML model. This is the first result and still preliminary. We are currently considering other methods to train the ML model without using the RTM at all.",2021/4/1,2021/12/3 13:08,2021/12/3 13:08,2021/12/3 13:08,EGU21-10475,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2021EGUGA..2310475L,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we aim to transform a deterministic neural network weather forecasting system into an ensemble forecasting system. We test four methods to generate the ensemble: random initial perturbations, retraining of the neural network, use of random dropout in the network, and the creation of initial perturbations with singular vector decomposition. The latter method is widely used in numerical weather prediction models, but is yet to be tested on neural networks. The ensemble mean forecasts obtained from these four approaches all beat the unperturbed neural network forecasts, with the retraining method yielding the highest improvement.

YFTS4NHJ,book,2020,,Geometric deep learning for medium-range weather prediction,,,,,,"Medium-range numerical weather prediction (NWP) is crucial to human activities. Reliable weather forecasts allow better resource management and are essential for disaster preparation. Modern NWP models provide accurate medium-range forecasts, but they require some of the largest computing facilities currently available. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are data-driven architectures preserving the spatial relationship of data with a low number of learnable parameters, thus having the potential to relieve this computational cost. As CNNs were originally tailored for Euclidean domains, current data-driven NWP approaches are based on planar projections of the sphere, which induces important deformations. This work proposes a data-driven medium-range NWP approach using a CNN able to perform convolutions natively on the sphere and integrating the temporal dimension. The effect of static and dynamic atmospheric features, as well as of the temporal discretization, is tested on the predictive skill using a wide range of metrics. Experimental results show that our method is able to emulate complex patterns of common atmospheric fields, and that our predictions are able to accurately reproduce the seasonal cycle.

The method was validated using data from 15 UK MIDAS (Met office Integrated Data Archive System) sites with a 9 month training and 3 month test period.

Due to an extensive computing time and a high power usage, these methods are unable to efficiently react to rapidly changing initial weather conditions. Also, most of the numerical weather prediction models can be less accurate for smaller regions with specific local weather conditions. These problems are addressed by a technique called nowcasting, which uses an extrapolation of various current weather conditions. Multiple research papers have shown that this technique can outperform traditional weather predictions for up to two hours. Furthermore, it can be improved using machine learning algorithms. In this paper nowcasting algorithms are used to predict a short-term precipitation over Lithuania using weather radar images provided by Lithuanian Hydrometeorology service. A Hanssen-Kuipers score is used to evaluate the accuracy of prediction against observed precipitation maps. The results of three extrapolation algorithms (basic translation, step translation, and sequence translation) and a single machine learning algorithm based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) are evaluated for two chosen hours and compared to the persistency algorithm. The average scores of each prediction algorithm for a single week are also presented. Although the results remain accurate for up to 45 minutes only, the accuracy can be improved by adding additional variables to the extrapolation. The better accuracy can also be achieved by using more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, like recurrent neural networks and their variations, that take dependencies on previous inputs in time series into account.

Precipitation nowcasting is hence significant for people to make correct decisions timely. For traditional methods, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP), the accuracy is limited because the smaller scale of strong convective weather must be smaller than the minimum scale that the model can capture. And it often requires a supercomputer. Furthermore, the optical flow method has been proved to be available for precipitation nowcasting. However, it is difficult to determine the model parameters because the two steps of tracking and extrapolation are separate. In contrast, current machine learning applications are based on well-selected full datasets, ignoring the fact that real datasets quite often contain missing data requiring extra consideration. In this paper, we used a real Hubei dataset in which a few radar echo data are missing and proposed a proper mechanism to deal with the situation. Furthermore, we proposed a novel mechanism for radar reflectivity data with single altitudes or cumulative altitudes using machine learning techniques. From the experimental results, we conclude that our method can predict future precipitation with a high accuracy when a few data are missing, and it outperforms the traditional optical flow method. In addition, our model can be used for various types of radar data with a type-specific feature extraction, which makes the method more flexible and suitable for most situations.",2020/11/11,2021/12/3 13:14,2021/12/3 13:14,2021/12/3 13:14,e8408931,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,www.hindawi.com,,Publisher: Hindawi,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/RGTCLVQ5/Xiang et al. - 2020 - A Precipitation Nowcasting Mechanism for Real-Worl.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the future precipitation growth and decay processes are unknown, there is a rapid decrease in the forecast skill. Without using a numerical weather prediction model (NWP) it is difficult to infer the future evolution of precipitation from a real-time sequence of radar images. Current operational convection resolving NWP models already have a sufficient spatial resolution for nowcasting applications (1-2 km), but are usually updated only every 1-3 hours, which is not enough for a number of users. Without significant advances in the assimilation of radar observations, it is unlikely that NWP will outperform a radar-based nowcast in the first 1-2 hours. In this study, we exploit a 10-year archive of composite radar images over the Swiss Alpine region to investigate the geographical distribution of precipitation growth and decay patterns depending on the direction, speed and freezing level height of the mesoscale flows. These variables are then used as input predictors to train machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict specific properties of precipitation which are relevant for practical hydro-meteorological applications, such as the growth and decay of individual intense convective cells. A verification and comparison of the accuracy of ML algorithms is performed using an independent test dataset.

TCs are generated in the low latitude ocean, and move toward higher latitudes with more intensity. Mid-latitude countries typically have a longer time to prepare TCs, while subequatorial countries have only about 1-2 days for preparation since the detection of TCs. Thus, detection of TCs at earlier stages (i.e., disturbance stage) is crucial to decrease socioeconomic losses. However, only a few disturbances develop into TCs among thousands of disturbances per year. Thus, accurate detection whether a disturbance turns into a TC is really important. Although numerical weather prediction models perform well for various atmospheric phenomena, they don't work well on TC-related simulation, because there is no proved mechanism of the TC generation. Recently, several TC early detection studies are conducted using satellite data, such as Wood et al (2015) and Park et al (2017). Those studies are focused on symmetric patterns of the wind or clouds to detect TCs. However, a symmetric pattern is usually found from almost developed disturbances. Thus, in this study, along with the symmetric pattern-based indices of clouds, homogeneity indices, which are distinguishable variable in early stages of disturbances, are used to identify developing disturbances over the Northeast Pacific. Two machine learning approaches—decision trees and random forest—were used for TC detection. The Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) level-1b images were used as input variables to the machine learning approaches. Combined joint typhoon warning center (JTWC) best track with national centers for environmental prediction final (NCEP FNL) data were used as reference data of the developing and non-developing disturbance tracks. Preliminary results showed that 9 developing disturbance cases in 2015 through hindcast validation were well detected from the decision trees model, but 18 cases of the 38 non-developing disturbances were falsely detected with a 24-hour lead time. The random forest approach yielded a high detection rate (100%) but a relatively high false alarm rate ( 47%) More optimized input variables and feature selection may further improve the TC detection.",2018/4/1,2021/12/3 13:14,2021/12/3 13:14,2021/12/3 13:14,11874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2018EGUGA..2011874S,,"/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/MTHLFSTM/Sim et al. - 2018 - Cyclogenesis recognition using communication, ocea.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Storm power outage prediction is therefore fundamental for an efficient and effective response to weather-based power outages. In this work, we address the problem of storm outage prediction by improving an existing outage prediction model (OPM) originally developed for thunderstorm and extratropical storms, and extending its structure for predicting outages associated with mixed phase precipitation (snow, ice, freezing rain) events. The herein developed OPMs use either regression trees or statistical models fed by numerical weather prediction outputs, leaf area index (LAI), infrastructure, land cover, soil type, elevation, and historical outage data to forecast number and spatial distribution of power outages during storms. OPM improvements for thunderstorms and extratropical storms consist in the introduction of new modules: a storm classifier, a multimodel optimization, and a module for implementing LAI. Cross-validation results show that the median absolute percentage error of the new OPM decreases from 130 percent to 59 percent for outage predictions at the service territory level, and that the OPM skills for operational forecasts are consistent with the skills based on historical storm analyses. Beyond thunderstorms and extratropical storms OPMs, two models are developed for predicting power outages during snow and ice storms: a machine learning (ML) based model predicting outages on a regular 4-km grid, and a generalized linear model (GLM) for power outage prediction at the town level. The most important variables for both models are assets, leaves on trees, snow density, and - for the ice model only - freezing rain and gusts. Coss-validation results show that the GLM has more skills than ML models for extreme events prediction, while ML models have better performance for lower impact events and present lower errors in the spatial distribution. The creation of reliable OPMs also allowed us to quantify the effects of a resiliency improvement on the power grid (the Enhanced Tree Trimming, ETT), using two independent methodologies. The first approach is a statistical study of the change of frequency of outage-free locations. The second approach uses the OPM as a vulnerability assessment tool to evaluate the change in the number of outages before and after ETT. From the statistical approach we show a 49% to 65% reduction of the outage-free grid cells during thunderstorms and extratropical storms coming from tree trimming. The OPM based analysis indicated that storm outages were reduced between 16% and 48% after performing ETT.",2019/4/24,2021/12/3 13:17,2021/12/3 13:17,,,,,,,,Predicting Weather-Caused Power Outages,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/B9TK8PQ5/2110.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results show that spatial averaging of NWP forecasts over $7 \times 7$ grid points provides a reduction of 3.42% Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) from NWP forecasts. Model output statistics with and without variable selection can further improve output from spatial averaging by 41.32% and 41.89% NRMSE respectively.

Using input data from satellites, numerical weather prediction models, and ground-based radar, this effort employs machine learning to determine optimal combinations of available information using fuzzy logic. Airborne in situ measurements of ice water content (IWC) from a series of field experiments that sampled HIWC conditions serve as training data in the machine-learning process. The resulting method, known as the Algorithm for Prediction of HIWC Areas (ALPHA), estimates the likelihood of HIWC conditions over a three-dimensional domain. Performance statistics calculated from an independent subset of data reserved for verification indicate that the ALPHA has skill for detecting HIWC conditions, albeit with significant false alarm rates. Probability of detection (POD), probability of false detection (POFD), and false alarm ratio (FAR) are 86%, 29% (60% when IWC below 0.1 g m−3 are omitted), and 51%, respectively, for one set of detection thresholds using in situ measurements. Corresponding receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves give an area under the curve of 0.85 when considering all data and 0.69 for only points with IWC of at least 0.1 g m−3. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that aircraft sampling biases resulted in a positive POD bias and the actual probability of detection is between 78.5% and 83.1% (95% confidence interval).

In this algorithm, the global precipitation measurement (GPM) product has been employed to train QPE prediction model. The real-time multiband infrared brightness temperature from Himawari-8, combined with the spatiotemporally matched numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the global forecast system, have been used as predictor variables for QPE. Among the variables used in RF learning model, total precipitable water and K -index from NWP data have the highest rankings, indicating the importance of atmospheric environment for QPE. To enhance the accuracy of RF models or to optimize model training, a sample-balance technique has been utilized to adjust the ratios of samples in non-precipitation/precipitation classification and quantitative precipitation regression data sets. Further sensitivity and validation analyses help determine the optimal RF classification and regression models for predicting nonprecipitation/precipitation pixel and rain rate. The selected RF classification model is found to predict precipitation area with an accuracy of 0.87. For predicted QPE product, the mean-absolute-error and root-mean-square error of RF regression model are 0.51 and 2.0 mm/h, respectively. Overall, the RF ML algorithm has a higher detection rate over homogenous ocean surface as compared with over land.

This study proposes a new cloud-dependent B strategy by adaptively adjusting the hydrometeor-included B in the cloudy areas according to the cloud index (CI) derived from the satellite-based cloud products. The adjustment coefficient is determined by comparing the error statistics of B for the clear and cloudy areas based on the two-dimensional geographical masks. The comparison highlights the larger forecast errors and manifests the necessity of using appropriate B in cloudy areas. The cloud-dependent B is then evaluated by a series of single observation tests and 3-week cycling assimilation and forecasting experiments. The single observation experiments confirm that the cloud-dependent B allows cloud dependency for the multivariate analysis increments and alleviates the discontinuities at the cloud mask borders by treating the CI as an exponent. The impact study on regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) demonstrates that the application of the cloud-dependent B reduces analysis and forecast bias and increases precipitation forecast skills. Diagnostics of a heavy rainfall case indicate that the application of the cloud-dependent B enhances the moisture, wind, and hydrometeors analyses and forecasts, resulting in more accurate forecasts of accumulated precipitation. The cloud-dependent piecewise analysis scheme proposed herein is extensible, and a more precise definition of CI can improve the analysis, which deserves future investigation.",2021/9/1,2021/12/3 13:21,2021/12/3 13:21,2021/12/3 13:21,3155-3171,,9,149,,,,,,,,,,EN,,,,,journals.ametsoc.org,,Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Monthly Weather Review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study area-West Nile Delta-is an important region in Egypt in terms of agricultural and industrial productions, whilst it is a vulnerable area facing extreme weather and environmental crises (e.g. flooding, soil salinization, and sea level rise), as well as in socio-economic respect. In the latest decades, the region suffered more weather extremes due to climate change; the severe rainfall events resulted in flooding causing heavy casualties and economic loss. Therefore, the project aims to build an integrated flood early warning system for Egypt. However, in order to tackle the issue of data scarcity of ground observation, this research seeks to apply satellite precipitation observation and numerical weather prediction (NWP) as the substitution (i.e. GPM, MPE and ECMWF data) and to develop an approach with the integration of Nowcasting and NWP for precipitation forecasting.Generally known that Nowcasting method and NWP both have limitations in performing local convective and formative precipitations, whilst in different reasons. The research seeks to improve this effect in Nowcasting as it has advantage in short term performance (i.e. a few hours) whilst NWP has advantage in long term performance (i.e. a few days). The findings from the vector field of Nowcasting indicate that the relativity between shift speed and shape changing speed of precipitation is the key for accurate prediction, which is the disadvantage of the optical flow approach of the Lagrangian method that Nowcasting applies as the main stream core. The research hence applies a machine learning approach-support vector machine (SVM)-to figure out the relativity aforementioned to identify disadvantage data that needs to be pre-treated prior to the Lagrangian Nowcasting. Meanwhile, by applying a phase-based frame interpolation method based on the Eulerian method to downscale the temporal resolution, it can improve these disadvantage data identified by machine learning so as to better perform in the Lagrangian Nowcasting. The integrated Nowcasting approach is expected to have better performance in forecasting and still retains low computational resource consumption.",2020/5/1,2021/12/3 13:21,2021/12/3 13:21,2021/12/3 13:21,11380,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: EGU General Assembly Conference Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2020EGUGA..2211380C,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It takes as input both regional weather forecasts and on-site measurements, and predicts relative power production loss up to 42 hours ahead in order to improve the prediction for the next-day energy production. The method is trained on past forecasts and measurements, and significantly outperforms a simple - but also useful - persistence baseline especially at longer lead times. It reduces the absolute error of production forecasts by 100kW and is comparable in skill to physics-based icing models.

We use model output from the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) climate model to train deep neural networks (DNNs) and evaluate whether trained DNNs can provide an accurate alternative to the physics-based parameterizations. Specifically, we develop an emulator using DNNs for a planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization in the WRF model. PBL parameterizations are used in atmospheric models to represent the diurnal variation in the formation and collapse of the atmospheric boundary layer – the lowest part of the atmosphere. The dynamics and turbulence, as well as velocity, temperature, and humidity profiles within the boundary layer are all critical for determining many of the physical processes in the atmosphere. PBL parameterizations are used to represent these processes that are usually unresolved in a typical climate model that operates at horizontal spatial scales in the tens of kilometers. We demonstrate that a domain-aware DNN, which takes account of underlying domain structure (e.g., nonlocal mixing), can successfully simulate the vertical profiles within the boundary layer of velocities, temperature, and water vapor over the entire diurnal cycle. Results also show that a single trained DNN from one location can produce predictions of wind speed, temperature, and water vapor profiles over nearby locations with similar terrain conditions with correlations higher than 0.9 when compared with the WRF simulations used as the training dataset.</p>",2019/10/10,2021/12/3 13:22,2021/12/3 13:22,2021/12/3 13:22,4261-4274,,10,12,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,gmd.copernicus.org,,Publisher: Copernicus GmbH,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/97GM46C3/Wang et al. - 2019 - Fast domain-aware neural network emulation of a pl.pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/29C28F5P/2019.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, commonly used weather files are typically synthesized to represent trends over a relatively longer periods of time, and are often unable to accurately depict climatic conditions that result from local contexts, such as the heat island effect, wind flow, even local temperature and relative humidity. This results in discrepancies in building performance simulations. This study proposes a methodology using recurrent neural networks to generate synthetic localized weather data that are significantly more accurate and representative of local conditions than standard weather files. The predictions were validated against actual on-site measurements, and achieved a low mean square error of 2.96 and over 185% improvement in validation accuracy. Overall, the performance of selected models has shown over 100% improvements in test accuracy compared with standard weather files and weather station data at the nearest airport. The proposed methodology can be used to morph generic weather files to accurately represent localized conditions, or generate localized data for a longer time span with only a subset of data available/collected. This is useful for downstream built environment applications, especially building energy modeling, since representative weather data capturing trends of temperature and other variables will result in enhanced accuracies of the building energy models. The method can also be used in urban analysis pipelines to enhance resilience against climate change.",2021/4/1,2021/12/3 13:22,2021/12/3 13:22,2021/12/3 13:22,107601,,,192,,Building and Environment,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,,,,Building energy modeling; Climate change; Deep learning; Gated recurrent unit; Recurrent neural network; Weather file,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initially, benchmark data available from local meteorological organizations are collected that includes the numerical weather forecasting data like temperature, dew point, humidity, visibility, wind speed, and other descriptive information. Once the data is collected, feature extraction is done by first-order and second-order statistical models. First Order Statistics, like mean, median, standard deviation, the maximum value of entire data, and minimum value of entire data, and Second-Order Statistics, like Kurtosis, skewness, correlation, and entropy are extracted as the features. These features are further applied to three machine learning algorithms named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

The refined grid forecast requires direct correction on gridded forecast products, as opposed to correcting forecast data only at individual weather stations. In this study, a deep learning method called CU-net is proposed to correct the gridded forecasts of four weather variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Integrated Forecasting System global model (ECMWF-IFS): 2-m temperature, 2-m relative humidity, 10-m wind speed, and 10-m wind direction, with a forecast lead time of 24 h to 240 h in North China. First, the forecast correction problem is transformed into an image-to-image translation problem in deep learning under the CU-net architecture, which is based on convolutional neural networks. Second, the ECMWF-IFS forecasts and ECMWF reanalysis data (ERA5) from 2005 to 2018 are used as training, validation, and testing datasets. The predictors and labels (ground truth) of the model are created using the ECMWF-IFS and ERA5, respectively. Finally, the correction performance of CU-net is compared with a conventional method, anomaly numerical correction with observations (ANO). Results show that forecasts from CU-net have lower root mean square error, bias, mean absolute error, and higher correlation coefficient than those from ANO for all forecast lead times from 24 h to 240 h. CU-net improves upon the ECMWF-IFS forecast for all four weather variables in terms of the above evaluation metrics, whereas ANO improves upon ECMWF-IFS performance only for 2-m temperature and relative humidity.

The data for this study come from patches surrounding storms identified in NCAR convection-allowing ensemble runs from 3 May to 3 June 2016. The machine learning models are trained to predict whether the simulated surface hail size from the Thompson hail size diagnostic exceeds 25 mm over the hour following storm detection.

The convolutional neural network statistically significantly outperforms all other methods in terms of Brier skill score and area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Interpretation of the convolutional neural network through feature importance and feature optimization reveals that the network synthesized information about the environment and storm morphology that is consistent with our understanding of hail growth, including large lapse rates and a wind shear profile that favors wide updrafts.

The signal to noise ratio for ground-clutter contaminated profiles is extremely low and extracting information using traditional techniques is very challenging. The objective of this work is to develop a regime-dependent physically-based correction framework to address the lack of near-surface measurements due to ground-clutter contamination. The first part of the work is to utilize Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model simulations in the Southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM) region to characterize the vertical profiles of the precipitation system conditional to regime, precipitation type and life-cycle. The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model data with spatial resolution of 3 km (close to GPM-DPR's spatial resolution - 5 km) at every hour since July 2016 are used in this study. First, the HRRR model output will be used to develop a dataset with vertical profiles of reflectivity factor and drop-size distributions using a satellite simulator. Then, a deep-learning based clustering algorithm will cluster the vertical profiles of reflectivity conditional on precipitation physics. The working hypothesis is that each of these derived clusters has unique probabilistic distributions of vertical structure and microphysics. The second part of the work is to classify the GPM-DPR observed reflectivity profiles into derived clusters based on parameters such as season, storm regime and time-of-day. These derived clusters provide the expected near-surface reflectivity factor structure as well as the precipitation microphysical parameters that can be of further assistance in the precipitation retrieval algorithm.",2019/12/1,2021/12/3 13:24,2021/12/3 13:24,2021/12/3 13:24,H13P-1980,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NASA ADS,,Conference Name: AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts ADS Bibcode: 2019AGUFM.H13P1980A,,,,,1655 Water cycles; 1840 Hydrometeorology; 3354 Precipitation; 3360 Remote sensing; ATMOSPHERIC PROCESSES; GLOBAL CHANGE; HYDROLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Passive microwave (PM) sensors such as Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) have observed microwave radiation properties of sea ice and open water and provided the SIC by using various algorithms since the 1970s. However, the SIC retrieval algorithms adopted for the PM observations show low accuracy in the Arctic summer. This is because the algorithms only use the PM observation data that could not reflect the unique microwave radiation characteristics of sea ice and open water in summer due to the effects of atmospheric water contents and ice surface melting by high temperature. In this study, SIC estimation models for the Arctic summer considering the atmospheric effects on the PM observations were developed by using the AMSR2 brightness temperatures, numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis and Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Four machine learning approaches―Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolution Neural Network (CNN)― were adopted for the development of the SIC estimation models. A total of 339 KOMPSAT-5 Enhanced Wide-swath SAR images in HH-polarization were acquired in the Pacific Arctic Ocean (East Siberian Sea, Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea) during the summer (July to September) from 2015 to 2017. We discriminated sea ice from open water in the KOMPSAT-5 SAR images and computed 42,480 values (samples) of SIC within 10 km × 10 km window. Eighty percent of the KOMPSAT-5 SIC values were used as training dataset for the SIC estimation models and the remaining values were used as test dataset. The brightness temperatures measured at each channel of AMSR2 and their combinations and the atmospheric parameters (atmospheric water vapor, wind speed, sea level pressure, 2-m temperature, and 925 hPa-temperature) predicted by the ERA-Interim reanalysis were used as input variables for the SIC estimation. The SICs estimated from the machine learning approaches showed the value of bias less than 1% and the value of root mean square error (RMSE) less than 9% compared to the KOMPSAT-5 SAR SIC values. The values of bias and RMSE from the machine learning models are much smaller than those from the existing SIC retrieval algorithms for the AMSR2 such as Bootstrap algorithm (bias of 8.8% and RMSE of 21.7%) and ARTIST Sea Ice algorithm (bias of 6.7% and RMSE of 20.3%).",2019,2021/12/3 13:26,2021/12/3 13:26,2021/12/3 13:26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,en,,Proceeding,,,,,Accepted: 2021-08-09T04:17:43Z Journal Abbreviation: AMSR2와 수치기상예측 자료의 기계학습 기반 여름철 북극해 해빙농도 추정,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/UH33NCRV/Han et al. - 2019 - Sea ice concentration in Arctic summer estimated f.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To overcome these challenges, a novel framework was developed for the anonymization and bias correction of smartphone pressure observations (SPOs) and was applied to billions of SPOs from the Weather Company (IBM). Bias correction using machine learning reduced the errors of anonymous (ANON) SPOs and uniquely identifiable (UID) SPOs by 43% and 57%, respectively. Applying multiresolution kriging, gridded analyses of bias-corrected smartphone pressure observations were made for an entire year (2018), using both anonymized (ANON) and nonanonymized (UID) observations. Pressure analyses were also generated using conventional Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System (MADIS) surface pressure networks. Relative to MADIS analyses, ANON and UID smartphone analyses reduced domain-average pressure errors by 21% and 31%, respectively. The performance of smartphone and MADIS pressure analyses was evaluated for two high-impact weather events: the landfall of Hurricane Michael and a long-lived mesoscale convective system. For these two events, both anonymized and nonanonymized smartphone pressure analyses better captured the spatial structure and temporal evolution of mesoscale pressure features than the MADIS analyses.",2021/10/1,2021/12/3 13:28,2021/12/3 13:28,2021/12/3 13:28,1867-1889,,5,36,,,,,,,,,,EN,,,,,journals.ametsoc.org,,Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Weather and Forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes many problems in the field quite complex ones, and also state-of-the-art numerical models are - despite their immense computational costs - not sufficient for many applications. Therefore, it is appealing to use emerging new technologies such as artificial intelligence to tackle these problems. We show that it is possible to use deep neural networks to emulate the full dynamics of a strongly simplified general circulation model, providing both good forecasts of the model state several days ahead as well as stable long-term climate timeseries. This method partly also works on more complex and realistic models, but only for forecasting the model's weather several days ahead, not for creating climate runs. It is sufficient to use 50-100 years of data for training the networks. The same neural network method can be combined with singular value decomposition from numerical ensemble weather forecasting in order to generate probabilistic ensemble forecasts with the neural networks. On a more fundamental level, we show that in a simple dynamical systems setting there seem to be limitations in the ability of feed-forward neural networks to generalize to new regions of the system. This is caused by different parts of the network learning to model different parts of the system. Contradictory, for another simple dynamical system this is shown not to be an issue, raising doubts on the usefulness of results from simple models in the context of more complex ones. Additionally, we show that neural networks are to some extent able to “learn” the influence of slowly changing external forcings on the dynamics of the system, but only given broad enough forcing regimes. Finally, we present a method to complement operational weather forecasts. Given the initial fields and the error of past weather forecasts, a neural network is used to predict the uncertainty in new forecasts, given only the initial field of the new forecast.",2020,2021/12/3 13:28,2021/12/3 13:28,2021/12/3 13:28,,,,,,,Artificial intelligence in weather and climate prediction,,,,,,,eng,,,,,www.diva-portal.org,,"Publisher: Department of Meteorology, Stockholm University",,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/2VMXXS3H/Scher - 2020 - Artificial intelligence in weather and climate pre.pdf; /Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/VPGSMJID/record.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, for now, most numerical weather prediction (NWP) models cannot deliver an accurate time and space estimation of surface wind patterns and wind gusts associated with the CS.In the meantime, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and ASCAT (scatterometers) may be used for the detection of surface wind patterns potentially associated with the deep convective clouds that may be identified on METEOSAT images. Additionally, the intensity of wind patterns may be estimated from SAR and ASCAT data. Based on this result, Deep Learning (or Machine Learning) is proposed in an ongoing study for improving the predictions of wind gusts, based on the combination of several data sources such as SAR, ASCAT, METEOSAT.

This study proposes a novel probabilistic forecasting method for wind power generation, which includes data preprocessing, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) training model with fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, and post processing of predicted-interval. The input data of the proposed probabilistic forecasting model include the numerical weather prediction (NWP) ensemble wind speeds, NWP spot wind-speed forecasts, and historical wind power measurements. For practical applications, measured data of power generation at actual wind farms were used to compare different forecasting models.

The method uses sequential Monte Carlo techniques adopted by particle filters, which make no parametric assumptions for the underlying prior and posterior error distributions. The filter also treats the underlying dynamical system as a set of loosely coupled systems to effectively localize the effect observations have on posterior state estimates. This property greatly reduces the number of particles—or ensemble members—required for its implementation. For these reasons, the method is called the local particle filter. The current manuscript summarizes algorithmic advances made to the local particle filter following recent tests performed over a hierarchy of dynamical systems. The revised filter uses modified vector weight calculations and probability mapping techniques from earlier studies, and new strategies for improving filter stability in situations where state variables are observed infrequently with very accurate measurements. Numerical experiments performed on low-dimensional data assimilation problems provide evidence that supports the theoretical benefits of the new improvements. As a proof of concept, the revised particle filter is also tested on a high-dimensional application from a real-time weather forecasting system at the NOAA/National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL). The proposed changes have large implications for researchers applying the local particle filter for real applications, such as data assimilation in numerical weather prediction models.",2019/4/1,2021/12/3 13:30,2021/12/3 13:30,2021/12/3 13:30,1107-1126,,4,147,,,,,,,,,,EN,,,,,journals.ametsoc.org,,Publisher: American Meteorological Society Section: Monthly Weather Review,,/Users/bbochenek/Zotero/storage/DDXA8A8D/Poterjoy et al. - 2019 - Progress toward the Application of a Localized Par.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study focuses on forecasting hourly solar irradiance using data obtained from the Southern African Universities Radiometric Network at the University of Pretoria radiometric station. The study compares the predictive performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, support vector regression and feed forward neural networks (FFNN) models for forecasting short-term solar irradiance. While all the models outperform principal component regression model, a benchmark model in this study, the FFNN yields the lowest mean absolute error and root mean square error on the testing set. Empirical results show that the FFNN model produces the most accurate forecasts based on mean absolute error and root mean square error. Forecast combination of machine learning models' forecasts is done using convex combination and quantile regression averaging (QRA). The predictive performance we found is statistically significant on the Diebold Mariano and Giacomini-White tests. Based on all the forecast accuracy measures used in this study including the statistical tests, QRA is found to be the best forecast combination method. QRA was also the best forecasting model compared with the stand-alone machine learning models. The median method for combining interval limits gives the best results on prediction interval widths analysis.

Provenance information is of central importance for detecting unexpected events that may develop during the course of model execution, and also for taking necessary action as early as possible. In addition, the need to share scientific data and results between researchers or scientists also highlights the importance of data quality and reliability. This can only be achieved through provenance information collected during the entire lifecycle of the data of interest.

Therefore, research on intelligent post-processing algorithms has always been an important topic in this field. This paper proposes a model output deep learning (MODL) method for post-processing, which can improve the forecast effect of numerical weather prediction. MODL is an end-to-end post-processing method based on deep convolutional neural network, which directly learns the mapping relationship between the forecast fields output by numerical model and the observation temperature field in order to obtain more accurate temperature forecasts. MODL modifies the existing deep convolution model according to the post-processing problem&rsquo;s characteristics, thereby improving the performance of the weather forecast. This paper uses The International Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) dataset from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the observed air temperature of 2 m obtained from Tianjin meteorological station in order to test the post-processing performance of MODL. The MODL method applied to temperature in post-processing is compared with the ECMWF forecast, Model Output Statistics (MOS) methods, and Model Output Machine Learning (MOML) methods. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the temperature field predicted by MODL and the observed temperature field is smaller than the other models and the accuracy of the temperature difference of 2 &deg;C (Acc) is higher, especially where the prediction time is in the first three days.

Oversimplified assumptions of aerosol mixing state in atmospheric modeling can introduce errors in estimations of weather and climate-relevant aerosol microphysical properties. A more comprehensive representation of the aerosol mixing state can be achieved in principle with a Particle-resolved Monte Carlo (PartMC) model but at added computational cost that may be prohibitive for direct invocation in operational numerical weather prediction or multi-year climate simulations. The aim of our research is to explore the machine learning (ML) methodologies for estimating aerosol mixing state metrics, which we define here in three different ways: with respect to (a) hygroscopicity; (b) optical properties; and (c) chemical species abundance. We adopted a data-driven approach, leveraging deep learning and statistical learning techniques, to take advantage of massive PartMC model simulations. First, we performed particle-resolved simulations by PartMC to create a series of scenarios considering a range of global environmental conditions. Each scenario consists of aerosol populations and corresponding mixing state metrics. The gas concentration, aerosol mass concentration, environmental variables and mixing state metrics of each population constitute the datasets for machine learning implementations. We have adopted and evaluated various configurations of machine learning methodologies in this investigation, embracing deep learning, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, and the ensemble approaches. After a rigorous model selection process, we identified an appropriate model to derive estimates of aerosol mixing state metrics. We used the computational and data resources of the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF) and the ORNL Compute and Data Environment for Science (CADES). The NVIDIA DGX-1 hardware was used for the prototyping of the ML models. Our approach has allowed us to gain a new understanding of how machine learning methodologies can be applied to improve the representation of aerosol mixing state in atmospheric models and benefit the atmospheric research community.
